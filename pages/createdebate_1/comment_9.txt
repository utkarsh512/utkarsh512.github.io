They really might as well since lunatics like you are allowed to have
them. Gotta equal out the playing field a bit.

	Aha. Nom caught thinking like a Conservative. Some reality
	accidentally slipped in... If the lunatics have em regardless, I might
	as well have em too. Welcome to the right wing.

	Millions of Americans have been economically devastated by the
	economic meltdown, by the deep recession that followed it, and by the
	nation’s ongoing economic struggles. Many of those needy Americans
	have reached the point where they consider a telephone a luxury that
	they cannot afford. The Obama Phone program (also known as Lifeline
	Assistance) can lift that burden. More than 20 million Americans have
	already received a free Obama Phone and get 250 free cell phone
	minutes every month. What seems to be your confusion ???????????????

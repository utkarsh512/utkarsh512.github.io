Comments:

Obama needs more drug dealers on the street wielding weapons to
strengthen his argument and imposition of gun control in America.
Ironic, or moronic, either way it's the Liberal Progressive mind-set
and will be used to attack our Nation's 2nd amendment.

Drug related offenses are not violent offenses, so we cannot reliably
conclude that the persons in question actually pose any danger to
their communities at all. And if they are actually involved in crime
that endangers the public then arrest and prosecute them for those
offenses.

	Drug dealers are not tied to guns ? Show me where drug offenses pose
	no danger to communities ! Oh i await this response !
	[Posted by outlaw60 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

		Not inherently, no. Simple possession can lead to a trafficking
		sentence if you possess more than what is (arbitrarily) designated as
		a "personal use amount". For those who actually are dealing, not all
		use drugs or other weapons; I have known a number of small time
		dealers who have never gotten into violent altercations in their
		dealings because they traffic in small amounts with a small vetted and
		established customer base. Of course, some people sentenced under
		trafficking laws are dealers who are involved in other violent crimes
		in association with their dealing. These people may even be the
		majority. It remains a matter of fact, however, that not all people
		sentenced under these drug laws are involved in activities that
		endanger communities. It is also true that drug dealers who are tied
		to guns and violence can be tried and sentenced for the latter class
		of crimes. We have specific laws for those specific crimes for this
		precise reason.

			"Last year, the U.S. Sentencing Commission retroactively reduced the
			sentencing guidelines for federal drug-trafficking offenders. In all,
			46,000 criminals will be released under the new guidelines." So you
			will buy into that 46,000 being released are all non violent felons
			correct ?

				Do you have any evidence, any at all, that they are violent?
				[Posted by GenericName at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

					Do you have any evidence they are not violent ? Or is it you just
					trust your Obie on that issue ?
					[Posted by outlaw60 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

						So you aren't able to prove they are violent, right?
						[Posted by GenericName at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

							Can the government prove they aren't ? Do you have that much trust in
							your loved Obie to tell you the truth ?
							[Posted by outlaw60 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

									Can your government prove it is the question ! So can they prove it ?

												So you aren't able to prove they are violent, right?
												[Posted by GenericName at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

												Can your government prove they aren't ? Yes hence why they're being

													You have the records of those being released ? I would like to see

													[Posted by outlaw60 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

														I would like to see the information you have obtained Yeah, I thought

												You can't prove a negative. .
												[Posted by Sitar at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

													Of course you can prove a negative. The sun is not cold. The earth is

													can be proved. Right?

																I am not following you around but you are stalking my debates. Leave

																[Posted by Sitar at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

						Yes, the punishment for violent crime is still in place. They can't
						be released if they are violent.
						[Posted by Cartman at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

							I am not totally certain, but I think that I agree with you.
							[Posted by Bildgesmythe at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

				So you will buy into that 46,000 being released are all non violent
				felons correct? No, and I never suggested that they were. My point is
				that not all of them are violent and that we cannot know which of them
				are on the sole basis of a drug sentence because that sentence does
				not correspond with what is classified as a violent crime. If they
				commit crimes which actually do qualify as violent crimes then they
				can be (and presumably would have been) charged for those crimes
				alongside the drug charges, but the drug charge alone cannot prove
				they pose a danger to their communities.
				[Posted by Jace at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

					You have proof that they are not violent ? Show me that proof that
					they aren't !
					[Posted by outlaw60 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

						The burden of proof is actually on you since you presented the
						original claim that they are violent, even though drug offenses are
						not classified as violent crimes. For the record, though, I have
						already presented a number of empirical facts about the U.S. legal
						system along with an analysis as to why this means your conclusion is
						logically unsound. I suggest you reread my statements more closely as
						I am disinclined to repeat myself.
						[Posted by Jace at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

							Burden of proof is on your government to prove they are not violent.
							Have you seen the records of those that your government say are not
							violent ? Link me up to what you know !
							[Posted by outlaw60 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

								You are evading the point. While the government may very well have a
								burden to consider the risk these people pose upon release, this is no
								way relieves you of the burden of proof you have within the context of
								this debate to prove your original claim. Your continued failure to do
								so, along with your repeated failure to actually address the substance
								of my analysis, indicates that you neither substantiate nor defend
								your view. I have not seen the records, and I very much doubt you have
								either. If we did review them, however, I have no doubt whatsoever
								that at least some of them would lack a violent record for the reasons
								already explained (which are tacitly conceded at this point). And,
								again, if they do then they will remain incarcerated for those violent
								crimes and may be prosecuted for any subsequent violent crimes
								independent of drug law (which is another point you have tacitly
								conceded).
								[Posted by Jace at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

									So if you have seen no records then how might you suspect that they
									are non violent ?
									[Posted by outlaw60 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

										For the reasons I already provided and elaborated upon above, to
										which you have yet to respond.
										[Posted by Jace at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

											So you cannot say they are not non violent ! Nor can you refute that
											!
											[Posted by outlaw60 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

												I can and have done on both counts, for reasons already provided. You
												have now had numerous opportunities to refute these arguments, but not
												only have you failed to do so you have not even acknowledged that they
												were made. At this point, the points are tacitly conceded on account
												of either your inability or unwillingness to address them.
												[Posted by Jace at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

													You have the links to prove these criminals that are released are not
													violent ! Do show where you can prove that ! I am waiting
													[Posted by outlaw60 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

														Statistics are not the only valid form of proof, nor the only facts
														of value in this case. I have already explained why. I will not do so
														again. The points are conceded, you have no proof at all even though
														the burden of proof was yours... and so this debate is entirely past
														its end. Take the last word if you like. I do not intend to reply.
														[Posted by Jace at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

															How many of those so called non violent criminals are gang related ?
															Did your government give those numbers ?
															[Posted by outlaw60 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

										If there is no record of them being violent, they are non violent.
										[Posted by Cartman at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

											No way can there be no record of them being violent .
											[Posted by Bildgesmythe at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

												The ones being released have no record of being violent. Why do you
												think there can't be no record?
												[Posted by Cartman at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

													Ouch, that felt good.
													[Posted by Bildgesmythe at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

								Our government says that you are innocent until proven guilty. If
								they didn't commit a violent crime they shouldn't be punished for a
								violent crime. Why do you want to put people in jail for having to
								potential to be violent?
								[Posted by Cartman at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

Criminals who did their time are being released. That's how the
prison system works. What is happening here is that we decided that
the punishments for drug crimes were ridiculous. A drug crime
committed last year is just as bad as a drug crime committed this
year. The punishment assigned to people this year is being assigned to
people who committed the same crime in the past. Those people are
being released because of time served.
[Posted by Cartman at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

The USA has a disgustingly high incarceration rate. I think releasing
drugs offenders is a very good way to deal with it. The article does
say by how much the sentence has been reduced though - I'd be
interested to know. Yeah cartoon character, your controller knows that
this is nothing to do with the guns.
[Posted by Atrag at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

I don't see that happening.
[Posted by Bildgesmythe at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

We definitely need to round up everyone who dares to consume
substances the government decides are bad and let them rot in jail.
Thanks for championing this big-government mentality.
[Posted by GenericName at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	You have missed the point have you not ? Your Loved Obie is dumping
	criminals on your streets and you have nothing to say about it ?
	[Posted by outlaw60 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

		No I got the point. You believe that the government should be able to
		tell us what we can and can not consume. Considering you are a
		proponent of big government, it seems like you were the one to vote
		for him, not me.
		[Posted by GenericName at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

			"You believe that the government should be able to tell us what we
			can and can not consume." This has what to do with dumping criminals
			on the streets ?
			[Posted by outlaw60 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

				Prove that you don't believe in big government and hate individual
				freedoms. Can you do that rightist ?
				[Posted by GenericName at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

					You are okay with criminals being dumped back into society by your
					Loved Obie ?
					[Posted by outlaw60 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

						On average, cows poop 16 times per day! Can you prove otherwise,
						rightist ?
						[Posted by GenericName at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

							That makes my dad look like a never-pooper... He poops 4 times a
							day...

		Prisons have been releasing criminals since the country was founded.
		It's in the 8th amendment. We can't keep people in jail forever just
		because they commit a crime.
		[Posted by Cartman at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

			Many people serving life sentences (and also multiple sentencing that
			stretch well past their nature life expectancy) would disagree with
			your observation.
			[Posted by Atrag at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

				Nothing lives forever.
				[Posted by Bildgesmythe at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

				No, they wouldn't. If they committed a heinous crime, they know they
				belong in jail.
				[Posted by Cartman at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

					In the USA they will spend the rest of their life in prison for
					things that they would spend a few months inside in most other
					civilized countries. Difficult to look at how everyone else in the
					world does it then look at your own countries and say "yeah you know
					what, due to our cultural idiosyncrasies I do believe I deserve to
					spend the rest of my life in jail".
					[Posted by Atrag at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

						Why don't you keep murderers in jail for more than a few months?
						[Posted by Cartman at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

							You know I am not talking about murderers. I am talking about, for
							example, people who gives drugs to their friends, and those that view
							illegal pornography.
							[Posted by Atrag at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

								I am talking about, for example, people who gives drugs to their
								friends This debate is about how America is no longer doing that. and
								those that view illegal pornography. Those people get out of jail
								already. You are not updating your view of America when we change.
								[Posted by Cartman at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

									That is true about the drugs, maybe I should actually read about it
									before passing judgement. I suspect that it is still much higher than
									any other civilised country but I should look into it. Regarding the
									pornography thing: 10 years per image viewed is the norm it seems.

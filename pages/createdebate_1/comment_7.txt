Well thank you for noticing the same thing I always notice. I guess
this goes in line with my beliefs that Democrats could not care less
about LGBT groups if it were not for money and votes. It's nice to
have new blood on this site that lives in the real world of facts. Let
me say what a pleasure it is to have a new rational member.

	Hey FromWithin, what do you think of my amazing Pagan techno? At the
	weekends I invite all my black friends over and we dance to it while
	cutting ourselves and swearing eternal allegiance to Lord Moloch.
	Isn't that awesome? https://youtu.be/PfVxVznTcFw

The Democrats seem to support any action or political ideology
providing it is anti-American and may damage the public's perception
of Donald Trump.

	of Donald Trump. That's awesome. Hey guys, it is now the Democrats'
	fault that Trump blew up a foreign military commander of a sovereign
	UN state. They cleverly manipulated him into starting World War 3 so
	they could damage his public perception. Lol. Your spiel is absolutely
	laughable. Poor racists and rapists. Always the victims aren't they?

		The Americans executed the region's most dangerous terrorist who
		organized the provision of weapons to terrorists groups throughout the
		middle east and beyond. This demonic individual supplied the Taliban
		in Afghanistan with explosives and weaponry which were used to kill
		American and British troops. Whilst you may rejoice at the deaths of
		allied troops most people are deeply saddened at the killings of their
		soldiers and celebrate the capital punishment of a merciless
		terrorist. Yes, Trump, and previous American administrations should
		hang their head in shame for permitting someone with so much blood on
		their hand to exist for so long.

			The region's most dangerous terrorist is clearly the United States
			military. It wasn't Iran who tried to start a war. Trump backing down
			is the last whimpering hurrah of a dying empire. The truth is, the US
			wouldn't be able to defeat Iran in an invasion considering its clout
			in the region and its asymmetrical style of warfare, and the DoD know
			it full well. They ran simulations that proved it. Iran, for all its
			faults, does not invade foreign sovereign territories or oppress other
			nation states. In fact, it continually has the distinguished record of
			being the first country to recognize the independence of self declared
			states, and has continually abided by international law regarding its
			own defence. Nothing that Iran has done in any of this farce has
			actually been illegal, unlike the USA. America and the allies in
			general like to cry "freedom", "democracy", but only when it suits
			their own foreign interests. The Yanks had no interest in democracy
			when middle Eastern and African states were nationalizing their
			industries and breaking up American monopolies on their soil. In fact,
			the Muricans generally, worldwide, have a problem with the self
			determination of nation states (besides Israel, of course). The truth
			is, the world is waking up. Imperialism is a dying policy. There's no
			patience for it anymore. Best get used to it.

				Trump backing down is the last whimpering hurrah of a dying empire I

				exactly this.

					Yep, I saw it. The Empirical curse. And I think it's right. The
					Americans have played fast and loose too long. People are continually
					wanting nations to abide by law. If we are to be a protector of our
					own planet, and to benefit as its protectorates, it is what we need.

						primary concern, which is simply power. Keeping it, expanding it and
						using it to exploit other, poorer states.

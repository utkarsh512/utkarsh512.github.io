Comments:

FDR will be remembered as the man who led america through the great
depression and WWII, Reagan will be remembered as a man who supported
terrorists and overspent on military

	Yeah, because that's what Reagan is remembered for, right? Lol give
	me a break! At least Reagan didn't have foreknowledge of an impending
	attack on the United States and do nothing about it.

			So did other Western countries. He didn't know that they were going
			to use them against us in the future. Hell, Obama's been arming al
			Qaeda in their fight against Syria. Overall, Reagan was a good
			president.

				When did i say Obama was a good president? Btw Obama isnt a liberal,
				hes a moderate conservative

					When did I say Obama was a liberal ? He's a democrat... just like
					you. Throughout history, Presidents have armed countries and groups
					that ended up turning against them later on. Reagan didn't supply them
					because he had some sort of secret desire for America's demise. He was
					simply doing what he thought was right at the time... and keep in mind
					that military decisions aren't solely constructed and carried out by
					the president.

						Im only a registered democrat, i dont believe in everything it stands

	It is pretty obvious that Reagan will not be remembered for that. The
	Republicans are always talking about how great he was, and the
	Democrats don't really argue that they are wrong. So, Reagan will be
	remembered as a good president.

		FDR helped the poor, RR helped the rich FDR led us through a
		depression, RR lead us deeper into a recession FDR fought the forces
		of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, RR falsely took credit for
		breaking up the USSR FDR gave relief to minorities, RR painted them as
		second class citizens whom live off welfare FDRs New Deal kept the
		poor from starving, Reganomics gave breaks to huge buisnesses who prey
		on the lower class

			FDR may be better, but I disagree that Reagan will be remembered the
			way you say.

				I didn't mean to say Reagan was the worst president ever, what i mean

				as

					You are in a small minority, liberals don't think he was so bad

						If they need a republican president to look up toward they have : Abe

						they choose to identify with reagan over them

							It is because liberals like him as well that he is able to be
							considered so good. Plus, it is better to use the most recent
							presidents because we can't really talk about Abe Lincoln when the big
							technology of the time was railroads. You guys should be talking about
							how great Clinton was. Too bad he had the intern problem, otherwise
							you could talk about him a lot. We should treat Clinton like Reagan
							and talk about him a lot because the economy was good then.

										No, worship is unhealthy, no one is perfect, i like FDR a lot but i
										don't believe he was the most perfect human being ever, talk to a
										conservative about reagan they talk about him like he was some perfect
										human who did no wrong. If you even say a comment negative about him
										they jump at you with overall insults as if it is something
										blasphemous, i know there are liberals out there who may do this also,
										but there not as many.

												Reagan did a few good things, but overall he was no different than
												any of the other cold war era presidents before him, his influence in
												my opinion did more negative than good.

													Other than FDR, who had more positive than negative? I have a hard

																							Trust me, you haven't looked deeper into Reagan... unless there is

																							It seems pretty obvious. I don't support attacking them, but Assad's

																									Yeah, well... I lean more towards the theory that Assad was behind

																			Yeah, he was the leader of the UNITA. He was supported by more than

											Compared to all of our Presidents, nobody can really say that FDR was
											a bad president... but the Reagan hate is entirely unnecessary as
											well. The majority of the negative comments that liberals make
											regarding him are usually based off of conspiracy theories. Look at
											the known facts and base your opinion off of that. What it comes down
											to, is that you don't like him because of the (R) that was next to his
											name. The letter doesn't matter! That's why we keep electing shitty
											presidents. Be proud that your nation had presidents as respected as
											FDR and Reagan. We need more like them.

												Im sorry but reagan did these things: 1. Support the mujahideen in
												afghanistan, whom would later form the very same terrorist groups that
												attacked us on 9/11 and that we are fighting now 2. Said we wouldn't
												negotiate with terrorists in the iranian hostage crisis but secretly
												gave them weapons 3. Ignored global warming and scrapped many
												environmental efforts ( such as the solar pannels on the white house
												that Jimmy Carter invested in) 4. Supported apartheid in south africa
												5. Called black women "welfare queens" 6. Supported violent anti-
												communist rebels across the globe whom are responsible for the murder,
												rape, and genocide of many innocents 7. Gave breaks to big buisnesses
												who abused thier workers rights 8. Called HIV "Gods punishment to the
												gays" 9. Voted against making Martin Luther King Day a holiday,
												calling him a communist 10. Overspent on our military for his failed
												and unnessesary "star wars project" I cannot respect any man who does
												this to my country

													1. Support the mujahideen in afghanistan, whom would later form the
													very same terrorist groups that attacked us on 9/11 and that we are
													fighting now I thought I already made it clear that Reagan could not
													see into the future . 2. Said we wouldn't negotiate with terrorists in
													the iranian hostage crisis but secretly gave them weapons Did Reagan
													bring his backpack full of guns and set up a booth for the Iranians?
													The CIA was negotiating for the release of the hostages. Desperate
													times call for desperate measures. I'm not sure why you're bringing
													Iran up anyways. Has that come back to bite us in the ass yet? We have
													tension with them, but we aren't at war with them. In fact, Kerry is
													meeting with them for peace talks sometime in the next few weeks. 3.
													Ignored global warming and scrapped many environmental efforts ( such
													as the solar pannels on the white house that Jimmy Carter invested in)
													I hate to break it to you, but neither Democrat or Republicans are too
													concerned about global warming. They say that they're " green " in an
													attempt to win votes. 4. Supported apartheid in south Africa But the
													Anti-Apartheid act was passed regardless and it's main enforcer was
													George H.W Bush. 5. Called black women "welfare queens" Never heard
													that one lol, but if we're pointing out silly things like that... then
													I'll just point out that FDR was a coke-head. 6. Supported violent
													anti-communist rebels across the globe whom are responsible for the
													murder, rape, and genocide of many innocents He obviously didn't
													support the murder and rape, but rather the anti-communism part. Like
													I said before, he couldn't predict the future. 7. Gave breaks to big
													buisnesses who abused thier workers rights This is just starting to
													sound like typical liberal bias. 8. Called HIV "Gods punishment to the
													gays" Never heard that one either, but I'm not sure what that has to
													do with his record. 9. Voted against making Martin Luther King Day a
													holiday, calling him a communist But MLK Day became a holiday
													regardless... so, what is your point? Personally, I definitely do
													believe MLK deserves recognition... but I'm not entirely sure if he
													deserves a holiday either. 10. Overspent on our military for his
													failed and unnessesary "star wars project" Not sure if I'd call it a
													failure considering it still exists today as the " Missile Defense
													Agency ".

			You have a slanted view. Here are some conservative arguments. FDR
			led us through a depression We would have gotten through the
			depression anyway and all of the government spending actually slowed
			down the process. FDR fought the forces of Nazi Germany and Imperial
			Japan FDR apparently also let them become a big enough power that it
			became a World War. FDRs New Deal kept the poor from starving FDRs New
			Deal led to a government culture of spend spend spend to fix the
			problem and has led to the current financial collapse. I am not saying
			that I believe that, I am saying that if you view it from a different
			perspective you can find a negative way to portray it.

				Im willing to own up to those, FDR wasn't perfect, he did some things
				i don't approve of, but what I'm trying to point out is that he
				contributed more positively to our history than Reagan, btw FDR tried
				to enter the war earlier to stop the germans and japanese but congress
				wouldn't let him. These conservatives worship Reagan like a God
				[Posted by Thejackster at 2013-09-24T12:34:22+00:00 - Side: FDR]

					These conservatives worship Reagan like a God I think this is a
					slight exaggeration, but it is still not so bad if you are right.
					Reagan is actually a reasonable president to look up to. He didn't
					blindly go conservative and he didn't even follow Reagonomics. The
					fact that conservatives actually like Reagan is a sign that there is
					still hope for them. Imagine if they thought Bush was the greatest.

Roosevelt's new deal reshaped American economics for about a century,
he regulated businesses, passed the National Industrial Recovery Act
and guided America out of the great depression. Reagan had sold
weapons to Iran and increased out debt.
[Posted by libertyFTW at 2013-09-24T17:36:16+00:00 - Side: FDR]

	Roosevelt was behind the Manhattan Project, which basically led to
	the Cold War. Now we have threats of Nuclear warfare across the globe
	that could literally lead to the destruction of all civilization. All
	of this can be traced back to a decision that FDR made during his
	presidency.

			Maybe... but I'm sure there could have been alternatives, rather than
			dropping an atomic bomb and killing a bunch of civilians. Hell, they
			could have probably dropped it on a different location. I think that

			killing military.

I think Reagan may have been the worst president we ever had, he is
at least in the top 3.
[Posted by SexyBanana at 2014-02-03T22:40:07+00:00 - Side: FDR]

While FDR was by no means perfect, he certainly did more than any
other President in the history of the United States has done, to
relieve the plight of the most vulnerable in society and ensure
stability in the economy. People often argue that the New Deal did not
restore economic growth and vitality -- and they'd be right. However,
the problem here was not that he was prescribing the wrong medicine,
it was that he wasn't prescribing enough of it. In fact, like Obama
today, he perhaps carried out a fatal mistake, in cutting back the
role of the government in 1937, instead seeking a balanced budget to
calm misguided inflationary fears. It was only after WW2, with huge
stimulus spending, that America bounced back. Nonetheless, when one
looks at Glass-Steagal, the alphabet agencies, the efforts he made
both to mitigate the instabilities of finance capital, and to ensure
there were jobs and a relief for the long-term unemployed. Reagan, on
the other hand, began a process which has come to cripple the US
economy. From deregulation to deunionisation, banks and businesses
were allowed to operate as if they were bandits in the Wild West;
meanwhile, worker's protections were all but stripped away, the false
theory of monetarism became the dominant philosophy in how to run the
economy, and -- lest we forget -- Reagan was a war criminal. Many of
the social ills we face today come from the sort of society and
worldview Reagan and his proponents promoted, that remain to this day.

Ronald Reagan even admitted that FDR was a wonderful President.

He was a better Politician and abuser of power. In the end, this is
all a president has to be to be deemed successful. ;) FDR didn't
really do anything remarkable and although the 'remarkable' things RR
did perhaps had negative aftermaths, he actually bothered to do
something and really put his neck out there for USA. Better attitude,
more assertiveness and extreme efficiency make RR the superior
President. Corrupt or not, he is superior.

	In that case hitler was the best leader of Germany cause he had more
	assertiveness and really stuck his neck out for Germany and bothered
	to do something, see how your logic doesn't make sense?

											Yes he did, reagan said if a white man doesnt want to serve a black
											man in a resaraunt, he has the right to, he also voted against every
											civil rights act he came across and opposed affirmitive action FDR
											denounced Lynchings in the south (which were very common at the time)
											as "organized murder", he provided many relief programs to minorities,
											and was very supportive of his wifes attempts to encourage
											desegregation in the military

												Reagan never said such bullcrap. Even if he happened to say it
												against my knowledge that doesn't mean that a black man isn't entitled
												to refuse serving a white man or even one of their own race (and a
												white to a white). This just means that you can't go to prison for it.
												that's all. If anything, that's very liberal to allow different
												opinions despite offence, that's true freedom. RR didn't exist when
												lynching were common. Unfair comparison.

													Nope, Reagan did exist when lynchings were common and began heavily

																		FDR is no hero. He was just as manipulative and fake as Reagan was.
																		Reagan was just more assertive and had an overall more pleasant way

																		crap who was better or worse since neither was my friend or anything
																		of the sort. RR knew what the right-wing stood for and stayed loyal
																		all the way through FDR was constantly battling on middle-ground never
																		really having a damn clue what he stood for or how to assert himself.
																		He was a safe-playing politician, not a big-dog per say. To be ranked
																		high in my book you have to take a gamble (and win, of course) Reagan
																		did many big moves and most of them won, minus his international
																		relations with the middle east.

												Affirmative action FORCES people to hire less qualified blacks over
												more qualified, whites just to meet a quota. It's utterly restrictive
												and against civil rights.

Reagan didn't sign an executive order to imprison people just because
they had Japanese heritage

The New Deal paved the way for our monster government that we have
today (not completely, the Federal Reserve also had to do with it).
and while Ronald Reagan expanded the war on drugs, FDR made marijuana
illegal for the first time. Sure, we can blame Congress or the Senate,
but Reagan has just as much power as FDR when it comes to government's
involvement with drugs. Reagan and FDR are both kind of assholes, but
i'd say Reagan was at least a bit less of an asshole due to his
philosophy of "less" government, even though he expanded the military.
FDR was more like "fuck you, government must grow... grow ... GROW!!!"
which still exists in the minds of elitists and Fascists today. Oh,
right, and FDR detained Japanese, Italians, and Germans for being
Japanese, Italian, or German. Both were war mongers, but Reagan was
more of a Bush style War monger, while FDR was more just responsible
for the Manhattan Project "lol, you want to create something that
could possibly blow a hole in our atmosphere? go ahead". I'd say when
it comes to comparing presidents, it makes more sense to ask "who was
worse?"

FDR had a lot good ideas, but he is the classic Fascist liberal. He
was elected four times, attempted to water down the supreme court,
unsuccessfully tried to stifle dissent within the democratic party.
Father Charles Coughlin is the classic example where FDR used his
covert powers to crush his critics. If you did not have a blue New
Deal sticker at your place of business, his undercover mob would make
sure you did.

They were both great presidents, and they both had their faults. I
just respect RR more than I respect FDR. FDR also how way longer in
office than RR so he had more time to get things done.

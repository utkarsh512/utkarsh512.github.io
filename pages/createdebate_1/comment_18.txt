In my opinion there's not a damn thing anybody can do to prevent the
coming wave of super intelligent beings from dominating short of
violently suppressing technological innovation -- and I don't see that
happening any time soon. Better hope whoever solves strong AI is a
nice person.

	Hahahaha... Jessald, you're scaring me. :P Actually, "technology" has
	always ruled. Those with the best tools, toys, weapons, and ways have
	historically ruled those who used older technology. It is unlikely
	this will ever change. Of course, we could end up in a religiohegemony
	and bring about a new Dark Age.

		You mean we're not already in a new DARK AGE??? Well mix my chips and
		call me a reel to reel VHS tape.

			Kukla, that made me laugh so hard I nearly blew a circuit! I'd say
			we're in more of a Gray Age than Dark... now we just need to protest
			with signs reading: CAUTION: RELIGIOHEGEMONY AHEAD

				Can't touch me there...I wear a Cross, a Mezuzah, a Budda and a
				Turban...I dare you!

					I used to wear a buddha, too, but the ache in my back from carrying a
					300 lb man....!

						Now you're a hump-backed dwarf from carrying that much weight! Had
						you asked me I would have shared my secret. I went out into the woods,
						lit a campfire, danced and spat, then threw his ass in the fire until
						he got down to size. He's a bit singed but none the worse for wear!

								Tell no one of this.....we'll make a million selling this to

I am not sure there is much difference. Technology without humanity
and morality or religion without an openness to advancements. Either
qualifies for me as a Dark Age. All I know is that so far we survived
the ice age, the Catholic Church and the bomb. I am betting on us
surviving global warming, stem cell experimentation/cloning/the
religious right/a socialist administration and whatever other bogeymen
are hiding around the corner.

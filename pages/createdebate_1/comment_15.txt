			You as well your family are mentally challenged and you have so noted
			that but let's look into another Hillary Lie you must have missed
			!!!!!!!!! https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/ fact-
			checker/wp/2016/05/23/ recalling-hillary-clintons-claim-of- landing-
			under-snip One of our all-time great fact checks was The Fact
			Checker’s March 21, 2008, report on Hillary Clinton’s false claim that
			she arrived in Bosnia “under sniper fire.” The article, written by our
			former colleague Michael Dobbs, was quickly followed by CBS News,
			PolitiFact and others — and ultimately became a defining moment in the
			2008 campaign for the former first lady. “I remember landing under
			sniper fire. There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony
			at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get
			into the vehicles to get to our base.” –Hillary Clinton, speech at
			George Washington University, March 17, 2008 Hillary Clinton has been
			regaling supporters on the campaign trail with hair-raising tales of a
			trip she made to Bosnia in March 1996. In her retelling, she was sent
			to places that her husband, President Bill Clinton, could not go
			because they were “too dangerous.” When her account was challenged by
			one of her traveling companions, the comedian Sinbad, she upped the
			ante and injected even more drama into the story. In a speech earlier
			this week, she talked about “landing under sniper fire” and running
			for safety with “our heads down.” There are numerous problems with
			Clinton’s version of events. The Facts As a reporter who visited
			Bosnia soon after the December 1995 Dayton Peace agreement, I can
			attest that the physical risks were minimal during this period,
			particularly at a heavily fortified U.S. Air Force base, such as
			Tuzla. Contrary to the claims of Hillary Clinton and former Army
			secretary Togo West, Bosnia was not “too dangerous” a place for
			President Clinton to visit in early 1996. In fact, the first Clinton
			to visit the Tuzla Air Force base was not Hillary, but Bill, on Jan.
			13, 1996. Had Hillary Clinton’s plane come “under sniper fire” in
			March 1996, we would certainly have heard about it long before now.
			Numerous reporters, including The Washington Post’s John Pomfret,
			covered her trip. A review of nearly 100 news accounts of her visit
			shows that not a single newspaper or television station reported any
			security threat to the first lady. “As a former AP wire service hack,
			I can safely say that it would have been in my lead had anything like
			that happened,” said Pomfret. According to Pomfret, the Tuzla airport
			was “one of the safest places in Bosnia” in March 1996, and “firmly
			under the control” of the 1st Armored Division. Far from running to an
			airport building with their heads down, Clinton and her party were
			greeted on the tarmac by smiling U.S. and Bosnian officials. An
			8-year-old Muslim girl, Emina Bicakcic, read a poem in English. An
			Associated Press photograph of the greeting ceremony, above, shows a
			smiling Clinton bending down to receive a kiss. You Wacked Out Leftist
			want to talk about Lies !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LMMFAO !!!!!!!!!

I thought Obama was stupid. He could stutter and have long awkward
pauses with the best of them. Reagan said, "trust, but VERIFY".. He
was right. And the left called him a Nazi. It ISN'T a matter of
whether he's cheating or not.. It's that we wouldn't KNOW if he's
cheating or not.. That cannot stand. No idea what this means. There
are lots of things we don't know about Democrats. They stand. Would
you like everyone to disclose everything? If they did, we'd have an
open season field day with corrupt leftists.

	I thought Obama was stupid. He could stutter and have long awkward
	pauses with the best of them. Usually, we don't base ones intelligence
	on whether or not they stutter or have long pauses in their speeches.
	I think, and correct me if I'm wrong here, but ones intelligence is
	usually based on what they say. For example, what you just said there
	would not be considered intelligent.
	[Posted by Goldtop at 2019-03-10T16:29:55+00:00 - Side: He doesn't know much]

		You never say anything intelligent. Neither did Obama. He thought

		there are. https://youtu.be/EpGH02DtIws

			So, you're not intelligent and you're a liar. Obama never said any
			such thing. Here's what he said... “… it is just wonderful to be back
			in Oregon, and over the last 15 months we’ve traveled to every corner
			of the United States. I’ve now been in fifty …. seven states? I think
			one left to go. One left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed
			to go to even though I really wanted to visit but my staff would not
			justify it.”
			[Posted by Goldtop at 2019-03-10T16:49:52+00:00 - Side: He doesn't know much]

				57 states with 1 left to go would be 58. Unless you think he was
				confused as to weather he has been to 50 or 7 with 1 left. That
				wouldn’t be better.

					Most likely he had a brain fart and meant to say 47 states. Why is

															Amarel, your intellectual dishonesty is so predictable it is

															Broaddrick testified about her alleged encounter with Clinton under
															oath, she denied having been raped by him. In her NBC interview
															alleging rape, Broaddrick stated that she had only denied being raped
															under oath to protect her privacy. Supporters of Clinton have also
															noted that she continued to support him, and appear at public events
															on his behalf, weeks after the alleged rape, and that Broaddrick
															stated that she couldn't remember the day or month the alleged
															incident occurred.[12] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill Clinton
															sexual misconduct allegations#Juanita Broaddrick Several witnesses
															disputed Jones' account, including her sister and brother-in-law.
															These witnesses contended that she had described her encounter with
															Clinton as "happy" and "gentle". In addition, Jones had claimed to
															friends that Clinton had a particular deformity on his penis, a claim
															that was revealed to be false by investigators.[2]
															https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill Clinton sexual misconduct
															allegations#Juanita Broaddrick Linda Tripp, the Clinton Administration
															staffer who secretly taped her phone conversations with Monica
															Lewinsky in order to expose the latter's affair with the president,
															testified under oath that Willey's sexual contact with President
															Clinton in 1993 was consensual, that Willey had been flirting with the
															president, and that Willey was happy and excited following her 1993
															encounter with Clinton.[3] Six other friends of Willey confirmed
															Tripp's account in sworn testimony, stating that Willey had sought a

	Hitler, Mussolini and Hirohito together couldn't defeat U.S. In
	fairness, neither Hitler nor Mussolini gave a shit about defeating the
	US. They didn't even want to fight Britain. The US got pulled into the
	war because it kept sinking German supply boats in the Atlantic Ocean.
	You have to be careful Alfie. This kind of military bravado about
	being undefeatable was exactly the shit Hitler filled the heads of
	Germans with.

		The US got pulled into the war because it kept sinking German supply
		boats in the Atlantic Ocean. That's odd. You said Russia defeated the
		Germans and that America had nothing to do with it.

				It's a historical fact that the Russians were the first army to reach
				and conquer Berlin. Right. After the Allies captured 8 million
				Nazis... I'm sure the reds could have gotten to Berlin with 8 million
				more Nazis to fight and gotten to the the Potsdam Declaration and The
				Armistice of Cassibile all alone... Keep dreaming buddy. We both know
				you're completely and fully mentally insane... Keep living the
				fairytale buddy. Keep living the revisionist dream...

		America entered WW2 on December 8th 1941 by declaring war on the
		Japanese Empire after Japan's sneak attack on Pearl Harbour ( big
		mistake ) on the 7th of December. On December 11th of the same year
		Germany declared war on the United States . This was another mistake .
		Do try to keep up old bean and stop trying to rewrite history by

			On December 11th of the same year Germany declared war on the United
			States. Are you fucking stupid? Nothing about that statement is
			inconsistent with what I wrote. Germany declared war on America
			because the American navy kept sinking German supply boats in the
			Atlantic ocean. Does that compute, you aggressively stupid halfwit?

		Nom, I try to like you. I agree with you often, but, sometimes you
		seem a bit "Trump-like" thinking you "know more than the Generals" (or
		anyone else). You have your opinions, as I said, I agree with you
		often, but I have my own ,and if I disagree with you, I will. I was
		there during WW2, you weren't. You sometimes interpret thing I say
		wrong, as you did here. I am not a bigot, I don't hate Jews. I don't
		go for childish name calling, that's another place we disagree. I
		think I know what Hitler filled people's heads with, I saw it on the
		"Newsreels", heard it on the radio … in real time. Don't "talk down to
		me", sometimes I feel "I" am on the upper level … and you are low. I
		stand by my statement, the one you carried off in a different
		direction, and became "Trump-like". ;-(

		You went to war because you thought you would be a cool badass if you

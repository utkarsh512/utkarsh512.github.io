	There are reasons sports are gender divided at the competitive
	levels.

		It's because we live in a world dominated by men. There are sports
		where women are as good as, if not better than, the men. In shooting,
		women are naturally better than men. Shorter torsos compared to total
		body height, more control over their bodies, better at keeping
		focused, the list goes on. Just look at the 2008 summer olympics
		results. I shot 50m .22 caliber competitive riflery for my military
		school in virginia, and I'm a certified Riflery instructor by the
		Civilian Marksmanship Program, I know what I'm talking about.

			... agreed, there are sports where women are better than men do to
			millions of years of evolution and natural body build. Acrobatics is
			another example since a woman's center of gravity is at the hips and a
			male's is at the chest. But that only proves guys and girls are
			different. I think that is the point. It is not helpful or even fair
			to pretend like guys and girls are equal physically. I should not be
			allowed to punch a girl in the face for example because she hit me
			first. That would be ridiculous and dangerous, and rightly the cops
			would come take me to jail, not her most likely. That said though, sex
			should not be the basis of any discrimination, if a girl can pass all
			of the same tests required for these special forces, there is no
			reason they should not be a seal or anything else.

	The gym I go to has probably twice as many girls. Yet I've never seen
	one of them lift more weight than even the casual male gym-goer.
	Statistically this does not back up your theory. In fact, there is a
	body building chick there every time I go almost. Her arms are
	actually bigger than mine, I still lift more weight than she does as
	do most of the guys there. I'm confused. Maybe you have a different
	definition of "stronger"

Of course they should, some women I know are quite tough excluding
women from these jobs is ridiculous. Women may lack bulk but make up
for it in other departments, intelligence, skill, stealth (light on
their feet), and an ability to multi-task unrivaled by men.

The problem isn't whether women should be allowed in special forces
or not. Since the not all women are the same (meaning some are just
more naturally adapt at being a fighter than others) The real problem
lies within the reasoning of those who decide whether women should be
allowed. The reasons behind is because "Generally" and I stress the
word generally, women are physically weaker than men. That cannot be
argued. Countless evidence prove that with the same amount o training,
a males body can withstand more blunt physical trauma (i.e hitting)
than a females. Not only that, countless test show that males
generally conclude their decisions logically the majority of the time
vs. Females. War isn't pretty, it causes all sorts of stress, trauma
and psychological and emotional damage to the person. During all this,
especially in the special ops, they need people who will think clearly
without emotions clouding their judgment. Not only that, generally,
males have been shown to prove to outlast females in endurance tests
with the same amount of training/ preparation. Basically, when it
comes down to it. The males body is more suitable to fight. Now keep
in mind these are all generalized statements and I pointed out that
this isn't the issue and is just the view of the military. On the
other hand... The real issue is the fact that it is generalized. Like
I said earlier, not all women are the same and some are more adapt to
fighting just as well to men. The real issue is they Military should
open it to all genders but have them go through a rigorous training, a
year if they have to, more brutal than the one they have now to make
sure that those who past are really fit to become part of the special
ops program. Excluding women out of some of the military's programs is
ignorant in a way to exclude some potentially valuable soldiers to the
military. The the issue in short is, excluding women out won't do any
good if some women can make the cut. Make both genders go through the
same training and weed out the weak ones individually.

I think that women should have the same oppritunites when it comes to
any field in the military. When it comes to special forces, I feel the
same way. On average, mahybe men are more physicaly enhanced than
femals, but there are exceptions. During the selection period for the
special forces, they will be able to weed out the ones that don't meat
the standard and the ones that do.
[Posted by sgt4002 at 2010-06-03T13:06:54+00:00 - Side: yes]

Yes I think women should be able to be in the special forces. We can
be just as deadly as men and I am against men only in the front lines.
I come from a military family so I want to be in the Special Forces.
Women are more flexible, agile, easier to disguise, quick thinkers.

The weak females will definately get weeded out during the one to two
years of training they must go through to qualify. Why would you look
down on a equal human being that just happens to be a female that is
in the special forces. They worked for it just as hard as the men in
the same MOS. Just because they are female though, they dont get the
same amount of credit and respect? Get your head out of your a . There
are women out there right now beating even some of the men in
training. Screw the bias about men being "genetically surperior." If a
female wants to do something bad enough and work for it and actually
get through the training for it, then she will &amp; deserves it.
Women sure as heck dont request special treatment either. They demand
equality.

	I am still a little bit divided on this myself. While I agree with
	your statement, the most convincing counter-argument I've heard is
	that particularly for spec ops who are in situations in unfriendly
	territory with few resources cannot provide accommodations for both
	males and females. Sexual harassment and rape is a big issue. Having
	males and females sleep and bathe in the same location is a No-Go in
	the Military.

the reason there not aloud in isnt do to wemen are weaker then men
its due to relation ships. what if a soilder falls in love with
another soilder and insted of focusing on the mission they focus on
each others safty more and cause the mission to fail. now if they
diveded it like all male units and all female units it would work
great

I think if you are capable and prove yourself equal then hell yea it
should be allowed! The men who say no are probably just worried a
woman can do their job better.

Only certain types of personalities are suited to the above

should be aloud to apply for a position if they are not suited to the
environment, they can leave just as males can.

You all are missing the point. Service is not about how strong you
are. Its about honor, integrity, and something special. Anyone who has
been to any combat training special forces or not.you know its rarely
the strongest big guy who ends up with the upper hand. These traits do
not know sex or race. You either have them or you don't. As long as
the training is equal this means no changes to training at all. Then I
think if they can pass. Then may God bless ass.

Men and women are different, but WE HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS. Not letting
a woman join SF just because she's a woman it's discrimination, that
simple. If they can handle the training, then they deserve the beret.

[Posted by 1009748 at 2014-01-28T09:50:18+00:00 - Side: Yes]

Females are not suited to that type of work. They commonly suffer
from ailments such as PMS, post-partum depression, menstruation, etc.
They are not strong enough. They are too emotional, as per their
raising. Males are commonly raised to hide from their emotions,
females are - either raised under the belief that, or by some natural
occurrence - commonly in touch with their feelings. Females are
necessary for the continuation of our race. One male can impregnate
many females. One female can only gestate one or a few fetuses. Thus,
males are more expendable. If we have even more soldiers, then that is
even less of a reason to ever stop fighting wars.
[Posted by TERMINATOR at 2010-04-28T22:09:44+00:00 - Side: No]

	There are females that are suited to being in the special forces and
	in the navy seals. Hell, they'd even sometimes be helpful (a lot of
	the special forces/navy seals operations involve blending in, and an
	enemy is going to be less suspicious of a woman). A woman's period is
	not at all a problem, either. Most women that go through basic
	training don't have their periods for that 6 to 8 week time. As for
	women usually being emotional? Sure, they usually are, but that
	doesn't mean that every single woman is too emotional, and that they
	should all be ignored. "One male can impregnate many females. One
	female can only gestate one or a few fetuses. Thus, males are more
	expendable." What does the "expendability" of a human (if you can even
	call it that) have anything to do with whether they should be allowed
	to fight?

		I think you're mistaking special forces for the more specific CIA
		Special Activities Division... the only types of blending in the other
		special forces do is with camouflage. Also just because population
		isn't a concern right now, if it was expandability would be the
		deciding factor.

			1) Special forces involves a number of different branches. While it
			is true that in popular culture media, special forces is shown as
			being simply a group of well trained soldiers, their jobs go far
			beyond that. One of the most important things that special forces do
			is to go behind enemy lines, support resistance forces, train native
			peoples, etc. When that group is presented as a group of guys with
			guns, that can be a very imposing, threatening image. However, if
			women are involved, there is the aspect of caring that comes natural
			with the image of a woman. Not only that, but there are situations
			where the more elite of the special forces groups must blend in with
			the native peoples in order to complete their mission. The groups that
			do this sort of thing (SEALs, Delta Force) are part of the special
			forces (Delta doesn't technically exist, but for all intents and
			purposes, it's part of the special forces). Adding women to the
			equation gives much more flexibility. 2) But the point is that
			population isn't a concern right now, so expendability is not a
			deciding factor.

		If all but ten males and five hundred females in the world are
		killed, then the human race is alright. If, however, only a few
		females remain, then the human race is most likely doomed.

	Not all females are suited to this kind of work, but not all males
	are suited for it either. Because of average physical size and
	strength, females may be less likely to qualify, but some of them
	will, and should not be discounted because of their gender. Contrary
	to the implication, women are not walking ovaries, ruled purely by
	tempestuous, unpredictable fits of screaming and crying. We have the
	mental acuity to control ourselves, although not all of us choose to
	exercise it. To be successful in the army, women would have to quickly
	be conditioned out of any irrational impulses, and remember the safety
	of themselves and their comrades is on the line, and I fully believe
	plenty of women are capable of this. Your second point might be more
	applicable if the human race were in dire straits as far as population
	goes. As it is, there is no reason to judge someone's value to society
	by their reproductive potential. Women should not be sheltered,
	coddled, or restricted from risky activities just because they have a
	womb.

			I don't see what the problem is. If women are allowed, and the

			I would have to ask if every man you know is a tough special forces
			type? The answer is probably no. On the face of it guys seem tougher
			and more able to take on this type of training. Women on the other
			hand (on the face of it) do not. I know women that could kill you with
			their bare hands. The worlds population is not made of only sperm
			machines and baby gestation units. Humanity is much more complicated
			then that. There is people of all types and excluding some one on the
			basis that they are female is the same as refusing someone based on
			color, race, creed or sexual orientation. I would say that it is a
			shame on the army to discriminate in this way as they could be missing
			out on valuable people that could make a massive difference. Your
			point about the future of the planet as a population is moot. What if
			the ten men left were sterile plus there is enough sperm frozen in
			banks the world over to regenerate the entire population of the
			planet. The truth that you speak of is in itself inaccurate as it is
			not quantifiable, show me empirical evidence that states that women as
			a population are not able to do this type of work.

	I do not think women should be in the navy seals or any other special
	ops teams. Not because I think men are better than women, but this
	type of work is more suited for men. There are already enough problems
	(when it comes to rape etc.) in the regular military with women. The
	special ops can not afford these types of problems. If you look back
	in time, you will see that the men did all the fighting. Its what were
	built and programmed for, to defend our families (this includes women)
	so that our families may prosper. Here's where another problem comes
	in. Since a male's mind is programmed to protect females, a male
	soldier would put his life at an unnecessary risk to protect a woman,
	and would therefore not only put himself in danger, but possibly
	compromise the whole mission. Also men are stronger both emotionally
	and physically (normally they are). Special operations cannot afford
	any breakdowns of any sort during a mission. Women can be strong, but
	they are not storng enough.The list of problem's goes on and on.

After reading the posts on this debate, I believe many here don't
understand that in the military there is only one goal, mission
accomplishment. Every choice or option will always, always, be
analyzed in its effect on how the mission is accomplished. Sure for
the run of the mill infantry women are acceptable, but in the
incredibly high-risk situations that special forces usually operate
this would jeopardize mission accomplishment to an unacceptable level.
The chance of ending up in hand-to-hand combat or some other similar
situation where women aren't equal to men is just too high.

	I don't agree. Maybe the worlds best fighting male would beat the
	worlds best fighting female but that is a hypothetical situation. Size
	and strength is not the only things necessary to win a fight and can
	sometimes be a hindrance. Women are more flexible, agile and can be
	just as deadly. The armed forces is governed by a majority male and
	Christian hierarchy the choices made are reflective of the sexual
	stereotyping that along with other forms of discrimination are holding
	the world back. It is these people that are making the decisions that
	are irrefutably bias.

why do people get upset when it has been prove that men are naturally

This is not an issue on a woman's determination to prove herself to
be as physically strong as the male partner in such military ops.
There is a reason why military, especially in the infantry fields,
tend to exclude women for deployment on those tasks. Conditionally,
whenever in situations like this; Women tend to think more than men,
and in the field, you don't have the luxury of enough time to think as
much in the comfort of a classroom. I've seen my share of arguments
from the woman's side in this subject, and most supporters tend to
advocate "women can be just as physically strong as man if she wants
to". However, that argument is irrelevant to the military's actual
reason for their decisions on this matter. In war, a man can think 12
seconds when in conflict to make a decision, a woman(and some of you
have to admit that you argue that women think a matter more thoroughly
than men) would take 20+ seconds to reach a decision. A bullet would
not wait for your thoughts to finish, the other side would not
restrain his trigger finger for your far more rational thinking than
man. Seconds are very precious in the battle field; An eight second
gap may not seem like much, but being a relative of more than five
Iraqi war veterans; Eight seconds is the difference between dragging
your body with a wound in the leg from a bullet, or sending a folded
flag home. Edit: I do not wish to come across as sexist, I'm merely
stating my point here

There are probably some women who could easily tough out the
training, but if women were allowed they would definitely have to have
women only teams (for obvious reasons) and also they would never be
used if they did have thier own teams or if they were allowed in the
seals period. Men are better at this work and the people in charge
know that so they would never deploy women

if women are in the special forces what if they are captured by the
enemy and do you think women could carry 50 kg and their back and run
20 km then stay up all right doing a massive work out then repeat
stuff like this for 20 days plus be able to put up with the mental
pressure, being yelled at, hiding their emotions and being in close
quarter with men for long periods of time

	yes they can the training is provided yo keep anyone incapable of
	hacking washes out. women will take as much as any man you also go
	through this wonderfull little training process called sear. survival
	evasion resistance and ecscape. in other words what to do when
	captured or risking being captured. if they f--- in the middle of the
	jungle thats their problem.

	Yes, I know some that are fully capable. What about being captured?

male chauvinist or not. the female body, is not made to endure the
pressure you have to deal with as a part of the specialforces. as
mentioned before, to carry a 50 kg backpack for twenty days, is tough
enough for a male body. it have also been mentioned that Scientific
test have proven that men naturely can withstand more than women.

	Women can naturally withstand more pain than men.

		yes but it takes a highley athletic lifestyle and years of physical
		pain to form the level of fortitude requiered women can do it i agree
		but it is less likley that a women has subjected herself to that it is
		a culture norm for men although anymore people are becoming preppy
		little wimps

hi everyone I'd like to say this, my father is a former SF guy and a
ranger and he's huge(6ft 215lbs, he also works with SEALs at his SOCOM
office). We were talking last night and I asked if he thought women
should be allowed into SF and he said "in my SFAS course we had 470
guys and out of those guys only 68 made it through. If 400 ATHLETIC
MEN can't get through SFAS then how could a woman get through it. Also
when you are on a UW mission you need a beard which Women don't grow."
I agree with him.

	im pretty sure that socom is aware that women dont grow beards. my
	entire family is militarily related and has served the country sience
	the beggining women can be disguised to blend into an area as men can.
	do you really think that there is a countrey of all men.

What if they are raped and get pregnant? .

	women will be made aware of the situation and the risk they take. if
	they sign the contract they accept it
	[Posted by REAPER-A at 2013-05-15T12:52:14+00:00 - Side: Yes]

		It is not fair to bring a baby into that situation. If women want to
		go to war, they need to get their tubes tied to avoid bringing a baby
		into a bad situation if they are held hostage.

IMPOSSIBLE! NOTHING is worse than Trump! There IS a close second,
though. Because HE can get away with more than Trump can (unless Trump
wins the next election .... then all bets are off)! The "President" of
Brazil has just surpassed U.S. in deaths per day. He is pushing
exactly what his buddy Donald J. is WANTING to do! He's even pushing
Hydrochloroshit! This on top of the fact that he's burning down the
world's oxygen supply :-(similar to how Trump "cares for" the
ecology!). Will the world survive Trump and his "buddies"?? Go play
more golf DJ! You do less damage on the golf course than you do in a
day in the White House! GO JOE! NO GOD would unleash a Trump (or a
wannabe) on a world .... not a "loving God" anyway!

	IMPOSSIBLE! NOTHING is worse than Trump A man that sniffs women and
	children, can't string two coherent sentences together, lied about his
	degrees in college, says restricting travel from China during a
	pandemic is racist, illegally unmasks Americans, and says "you aint
	black if you vote for someone else" is worse than Trump.

		Do you actually think it is illegal for a president or vice-president
		to unmask a classified name?

			It's not illegal to unmask with approval from a FISA court. It is
			illegal to lie to a FISA court in order to unmask.

				That's not the actual unmasking process - the intelligence agencies
				themselves (e.g. the NSA, FBI, CIA, etc.) have a process where the
				redacted name can be requested. No lying nor any court were involved
				(except that the FISC approved the agency processes.)

					As for Michael Flynn, they don't know who is being unmasked. The
					media are playing word games to deceive those not familiar with the
					process. For example, "unmasking isn't insidious or abnormal", knowing
					those making claims aren't making THAT claim. The odds that they
					miraculously unmasked Michael Flynn on a call where we are shown no
					transcript evidence of nefarious dealings is astronomical. Occum's
					Razor. They knowingly targeted Flynn and not an unknown person
					innocently and randomly.

						Occam's Razor Then, here's the simpler story: Flynn talked with the
						Russian Ambassador during the transition and suggested how to respond
						to Obama's sanctions, and discussed how to vote in the UN regarding
						Israel. The NSA recorded the Russian Ambassador's phone calls
						(including Flynn whose name was redacted.) People who needed to know
						who was having those conversations requested unmasking the name. The
						NSA approved it. When questioned by the FBI, Flynn lied about the
						conversations. Flynn admitted to the lying.

					Here a left wing outlet trying to run cover for the Obama
					administration and the intelligence agencies. The article:
					"Surveillance of Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. revealed he had
					interacted with an unnamed American who may have been undercutting
					efforts to pressure Vladimir Putin’s government."

					mean/2020/05/13/ 8c1cd578-9578-11ea-87a3-22d324235636
					story.html?outputType=amp Reality: They know the casual reader won't
					catch that the system Iis set up to spy on foreign entities, not
					Americans, and that Flynn was "unmasked" while doing surveillance on a
					foreign entity. In other words, they hid behind the claim that they
					were doing surveillance on Russia, and Flynn just "coincidentally"
					happened to be on the other end of that call. Evidence is pointing
					towards them targeting him, which is illegal, rather than a foreign
					entity and him being caught up in foreign surveillance. Also, the
					leaking of this classified information to the Washington Post was and
					is a felony.

						Reality You are not qualified to comment on reality because you are
						thoroughly and irrevocably insane. Every word which leaves your lips
						is an attempt to bring back the guiding principles of European
						fascism. Principles like, "praise the Nazis and then source the Nazis
						for proof that the Nazis need to be praised". Fuck off you worm.
						Sooner or later you will get what's coming to you pal. I guarantee it.
						The universe pays its debts.

						"Evidence is pointing towards them targeting him" What evidence? "the
						leaking of this classified information" See - you might be able to
						read after all. It is the leaking which is the only (potential) crime
						that happened related to the unmasking. Not the unmasking itself.

					Warrants to Spy on Trump Campaign Lacked Probable Cause, DOJ Admits
					The Inspector General’s Report The wheels came off the Trump-Russia
					collusion bus in December, when the Justice Department’s Office of
					Inspector General published a report titled “Review of Four FISA
					Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane
					Investigation.” Michael Horowitz, the inspector general of the Justice
					Department, testifying before Congress, laid bare the gross
					deficiencies in the FBI’s investigation. Horowitz noted seven
					significant inaccuracies and omissions, as we wrote about here.
					Horowitz’s report got the attention of the FISA court. Judge Rosemary
					M. Collyer, presiding judge at the time, entered an order Dec. 17.
					Collyer directed that “the government shall, no later than January 10,
					2020, inform the [court] in a sworn written submission of what it has
					done, and plans to do, to ensure that the statement of facts in each
					FBI application accurately and completely reflects information
					possessed by the FBI that is material to any issue presented by the
					application.” That’s strong stuff coming from the FISA court,
					especially since the rebuke was public. On Jan. 7, the new presiding
					judge, James “Jeb” E. Boasberg, entered another order “regarding the
					handling and disposition of information,” seeking detailed information
					about how the government planned to handle sensitive matters before
					the court in the future. Boasberg noted that the court had received
					notice of “material misstatements and omissions” in the third and
					fourth FISA applications against former Trump campaign aide Carter
					Page. Boasberg’s order referred to a letter sent to the court by the
					Justice Department on Dec. 9, which contained the following statement:
					“DOJ assesses that with respect to the applications in Docket Numbers
					17-375 and 17-679, ‘if not earlier, there was insufficient predication
					to establish probable cause to believe that Page was acting as an
					agent of a foreign power.’” But Boasberg’s order contained another
					interesting statement. The judge wrote that “the Government apparently
					does not take a position on the validity of the authorizations in [the
					first and second FISA warrant applications regarding Page, but intends
					to sequester information acquired pursuant to those dockets in the
					same manner as information acquired pursuant to subsequent dockets.”
					In nonlawyer speak, that means the government isn’t using any of the
					evidence it may have gotten as a result of spying on Page based on any
					of the four FISA warrants. Who Signed Off on FISA Warrants Under the
					applicable rules, FISA warrant applications must be signed by senior
					Justice Department officials. With respect to the warrants to spy on
					Page, the first application in October 2016 was signed by then-FBI
					Director James Comey and then-Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates.
					Collyer approved the application. The second application in January
					2017 also was signed by Comey and Yates. Judge Michael Mosman approved
					the application. The third application in April 2017 was signed by
					Comey and then-acting Attorney General Dana Boente. Judge Anne Conway
					approved the application. Finally, the fourth application in June 2017
					was signed by then-Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe and then-Deputy
					Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. The application was approved by Judge
					Raymond Dearie. The Justice Department responded to Collyer’s order
					with a 15-page filing Jan. 10. The response explains the FBI’s
					accuracy procedures in the context of applying for a FISA warrant, as
					well as the historical guidance provided to agents in the Justice
					Department’s National Security Division (who appear before the FISA
					court). https://www.heritage.org/ crime-and-justice/commentary/

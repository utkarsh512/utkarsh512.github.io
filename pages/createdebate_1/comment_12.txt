Comments:

I don't agree entirely with this, but automatic and semi automatic
weapons should be banned. Gun don't kill people, people do is a valid
statement, but a homicidal person with a semi automatic weapon can
kill a whole lot more people before being controlled than if they had
a knife. As for non-automatic weapons, they should require a license.

	The beliefm that automatic weapons should be banned holds no more
	water than any other arguement. A gun is a gun. the mmount of fire it
	produces makes no difference, and in the hands of an ordinary law
	abiding citizen a tank, granade launcher or nuclear missile does not
	pose a threat to anyone becuase he has no intention of using it. In
	the hands of a criminal, an ink pen can be rammed into an eye and used
	to kill someone.

		A gun is a gun. Baloney. If a person goes crazy and kills 10 people
		vs killing 100 people - ask the other 90 if the lethality of the
		weapon makes a difference. in the hands of an ordinary law abiding
		citizen a tank, granade launcher or nuclear missile does not pose a
		threat Every criminal was an ordinary law abiding citizen until the
		moment they weren't. There is also the risk of accident, theft, etc.

													If you think about it, semi-automatic weapons are much more dangerous
													than fully-auto weapons are. Fully-automatic weapons are chambered for
													thinner rounds, making them less effective at killing.

			What are you trying to say here? Guns are all equally lethal; their
			one purpose is to kill. Every criminal was an ordinary law abiding
			citizen until the moment they weren't. Okay, fair enough. So, should
			we attempt to take away means of crime or attempt to prevent the
			upbringing of criminals? Both seem equally difficult. There is also
			the risk of accident, theft, etc. Again, this is punishing the good

				prudent steps towards each. this is punishing the good Samaritan

					Is a BB gun as lethal as an Uzi? You've got me there, I presume.
					Most, but not all guns, are almost equally lethal. towards each

					always be possible. You can't stop crime from happening unless you
					stop the criminal from being created. At least, that's how I see it.

			lethality The only way the lethality of a gun can change is if you
			use BBs instead of rounds. until the moment they weren't That doesn't

	i dont agree, it doesnt matter what kind of gun it was. IF Auto GUNS
	DIDNT EXIST... it STILL woulda heppened..... IF NO GUNS EXISTED AT
	ALL..... it still woulda happened...... same amount of people... same
	outcome... wich is people dead.. i DO think they would of still killed
	20 kids and 6 teachers if that was his intention...... never said
	anything about slapping either... i said that he would train and
	train... idc if it took 10 years..... he wouldve made it a POINT... to
	make what he wanted to happen... happen.. he would plan it to the T...
	and make sure that they died.. if thats what he wanted... one way or
	another.. without a gun or knife... if thats what he wanted... thats
	how crazy people work. i dont agree..... if those people ( crazy
	people ) had a sledgehammer ( a gun) i DO NOT think that they would
	drive the coffin ( kill people) in the ground faster than if they had
	a regular hammer... ( their own fists and feet ) ...... Because.....
	Those people who are crazy enough to do that, are also crazy enough to
	make SURE it happens.. and put plan, and effort into it... they would
	learn martial arts, (the kind that can kill people in the blink of an
	eye ( the same speed as a bullet))... our human body is just as
	dangerous as a gun... and those crazy ass people would put so much
	training and planning into their actions that the same result would
	happen. ( my opinion ( as this is a debate)).

		I'm gonna have to disagree with you there. No matter how hard a
		martial artist trained, I don't see how they could be able to kill
		people as fast as a semi-automatic weapon. Yes, people would have
		still been killed, but that many? I don't think so. When I say yes to
		the question "Should guns be banned in America?", I don't believe that
		hunting guns would need to be banned. Yes, they can kill people, but
		not as fast as a semi-automatic, giving more time for the criminal to
		be stopped. I do not see the need for semi-automatic weapons to be
		purchased by anyone. When you go hunting, I doubt you assault the
		deer. I do agree with you on what you said about how crazy people will
		go far to make their point, but I still believe that semi-automatics
		should be banned. That is just my opinion.

		People use knives to kill people - should we ban knives? What happens
		if you ban guns is that people who don't follow the law are just going
		to keep their guns and people who follow the law can't protect
		themselves, so the criminals would find it easier to kill them.

The argument "no, guns don't kill people" is ridiculous. Everyone has
seen a shooting movie where someone ends up dead via gun. The reason
people go to war with guns is because they kill people.

i do not think all guns should be banned, but certainly some. if your
a hunter and you want to kill a deer, then go and by a rifle, but do
you really need an AK-47 to kill a little deer? and if your buying a
gun for protection, then that is just stupid. there are plenty of
things you can do before resorting to a gun for protection. get a
guard dog, buy an alarm, or move near a place with a lower crime rate.
you could also buy a taser or pepper spray.
[Posted by ungernick28 at 2009-10-20T19:10:36+00:00 - Side: yes]

	First, AK-47s have to be semi automatic to be available for civilian
	use. Second, dogs are good for protection, but mainly intimidation. (I
	have a German Shepherd and a Great Pyrenees so I'm NOT saying dogs
	aren't good for keeping your house safe). A bullet in a dog will stop
	any breed of dog you have, even if it is a 100lb+ dog. Also, guns are
	great for protection. If you have a shotgun, a robber that just hears
	you when you cock it will think "#@$%!" And if it comes to it, a
	homeowner will normally pull the trigger in self defense (be sure to
	get him good in the first shot because only the first shot counts as
	self defense, all the other shots are assault =D). Pepper spray and
	tasers are do not have the stopping power to save you from a criminal.
	If s/he is flailing on the ground he can still pull the trigger, and
	might hit you. Lastly, what has America come to when you have to move
	your home because of crime rates? If you want to save money, buy a gun
	and any other form of defense you want.

			That depends on the person, an elderly person or computer nerd, or

The second amendment wasnt for people to start killing each other, it
was for the creation of the militia. Guns in America, are supposed to
keep this world a better place, however, it doesnt do that at all, it
only allows criminals to commit crimes. It definetly doesnt protect
anyone from anything, it only harms the people of this country. And
yea, I get that many people save themselves from the criminals that
break into their house or try to rape them, but half the time thats
not the case.

	"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free
	State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be
	infringed." I find is odd all the responses, so far in the debate,
	have not touched on the main reason, in my mind, why I would never let
	the law makers take the 2nd amendment away. It's not for the
	protection of home invaders, it's not for hunting and it's not even
	for attacks on the street, it's for protection from the powers to be.
	I believe the MAIN reason we should all support the 2nd amendment is
	to keep the power of gun ownership in our hands and not in the hands
	of the government. If all American citizens loose their right to gun
	ownership the only ones left with the guns are the police.... and this
	is a scary thought.

	who is committing a crime? "...It definetly doesnt protect anyone from
	anything, it only harms the people of this country." You're joking,
	right? You don't think peoples lives have been saved because they
	carry a firearm? Why do you think people choose to carry guns in the
	first place? Because they want to shoot someone? Let's look at BIG
	PICTURE, for a moment: GUNS protected the LIFE and LIBERTY and FREEDOM

			They would shoot the criminal so they can protect themselves, their

							that is a rediculous arguement, thats like saying, people still
							murder we may as well make it legal. On the contrary, it's your
							spelling that is "rediculous". There is no such thing as a "safe"
							murder, murder inevitably always violates someone's rights. There is
							such a thing as "safe" Gun ownership which itself violates nobody's
							rights, your comparison is nonsense. and this is something i dont
							understand about you americans, why do you want guns so much? Because
							it is our Constitutional Right. Because they allowed us to earn our
							independence? Because we have a long and storied hunting culture. the
							only thing they are there for is to kill and harm others Well you're
							ignoring the fact that Guns are also used for sport shooting, and
							hunting. Not to mention the very fact that someone posses a firearm is
							often enough to scare off a would-be criminal. If this isn't enough
							guns have in instances been used to defend one's family against home
							intruders. They are also a safeguard against tyranny. If criminals
							aren't following the current gun regulations that we already have,
							what makes you think they are going to follow a prohibition on
							firearms? Remember the United States is not an island, we will always
							have easy access to firearms whether they are legal or illegal. the
							fact that you have some flimsy piece of paper This 'flimsy' piece of
							paper guarantees our rights as citizens, it protects us from our own
							government and it protects us from foreign governments. It has been
							the inspiration for other constitutions around the world. It
							extrapolates the views that unite Americans as a people, and has been
							instrumental in our rise to dominance as a world power. It is the
							bedrock of my nation and it ensures my liberty. It may not mean a lot
							to you, but I defend this "flimsy" piece of paper with my very life,
							not the paper itself but the ideas and principals that it represents.
							If you don't understand this, you will never have an understanding
							that transcends your little cultural bubble. i dont see a single valid
							reason why you should have a gun and yet there are plenty of reasons
							that you shouldnt have them. I just listed a bunch of reasons: -We
							have a Constitutional Guarantee -Recreational Hunting -Sport shooting
							-Deters would-be criminals -Safeguard against tyranny -Protect home To
							say you didn't see a single reason is to say your eyes were closed.
							You cannot win a debate with denial. Part of the fear of firearms is
							with negative cultural associations, particularly with gun crime, but
							firearms along with just about anything else can be misused, this is
							not in itself justification to ban or prohibit ownership of such
							possessions. Knives are used almost as often if not more so in crimes
							than are guns, the reason nobody is pushing to ban knives is because
							knives don't have the same negative cultural association guns have.
							Please give me the reasons you think we shouldn't be allowed to own
							firearms. the war on drugs we have to fight just like we fight the war
							on terrorism, it may not be sucessful but its far better than the
							alternative. I think we should attempt to help drug addicts, but
							punishing people for an addiction is pure insanity. People are getting
							locked up even for harmless drugs like Marijuana and yet many more
							dangerous drugs, more addictive drugs, are completely legal such as
							prescription drugs. The Drug War, is complete BS, just like your
							argument.

		am not American and in Europe you need a license to buy guns which
		already by far lowers the crime rate. America or the world with out
		guns would be a better place with less shootings, by far. Guns only
		protect from other guns and create firefights the military and police
		may need them but for what does anyone else need them? the police can
		protect you with no guns you aren't a threat to criminals and they
		wont have guns. I rest my case

	The second amendment was created for the following reasons: deterring
	undemocratic government, repelling invasion, suppressing insurrection,
	facilitating the natural right of self defense, participating in law
	enforcement and slave control in slave states (no longer applicable).
	So the second amendment is in place so people can kill other people
	under certain circumstances, that is of course what guns are for in
	the first place. Theres good reason why 12 year olds can't vote, or
	for that matter own guns.

	Regardless of whether or not you think guns cause more harm than
	good, this is not the issue. We have a constitutional guarantee , a
	right to bear arms. We cannot simply disregard the constitution when
	we don't like what it says. The right to bear arms, is a check on the
	government. It was set in place to ensure that if the government
	oversteps it's boundaries that the collective will of the people,
	could if necessary revolt and start from scratch. It is meant as a
	last resort against tyranny.

			Do you really think that if the government were to try and take over,
			that your 22 in your gunsafe is going to hold off trained soldiers
			with automatic rifles? In today's society there is no reason for guns.
			The right to bear arms was fine when everyone had the same revolver or
			single-round chambered rifle, but things have changed a bit since
			then. Firstly, I am a trained soldier. And most soldiers never move
			their weapon's selector off semi . Secondly, Many civilians own
			rifles; my brother owns an AR-15 (legally). Many Hunters practically
			own an arsenal. There are many civilian based "Militias" around the
			country. Many military grade weapons are actually legal to own.
			Certain miniguns are legal to own in many states, due to the sheer
			impracticality of committing a crime with them (due to their size).
			Not to mention the number of weapons owned illegally. Thirdly, if
			there was such an event where the civilian populace felt it needed to
			overthrow the government, I'm fairly confident many military members
			would resign or defect to join that cause. Finally, there are 300
			million Americans and enough guns to arm everyman woman and child 3
			times over, if the civilian population was determined enough, no
			military force on earth could stop them. Determination is everything
			in war. Remember we lost the Vietnam war because we did not have the
			will to take the war to it's full conclusion, and we won the
			Revolutionary war against a superior force because we had the will and
			determination to fight it until the very end.

			Ok let me say something and don't take offense for voicing my
			opinion. The very idea to ban a constitutionally gurranteed right is
			unconstitutional. I am sure that you live in a large city such as New
			York or Chicago and work in a cubicle everyday isulated from all of
			the real threats the outside world presents. I can assure you that if
			some one broke into your house tonight and shot your family your
			opinions about the right to own guns would change. You would go out
			and buy a pistol and be waitinag for the chance to use it. I live in
			North Carolina and this debate is close to my heart. I have seen first
			hand what happens when whistle blowers like you get involved and screw
			things up for our country. Our country was based on the fact that a
			man could buy a gun and live out in the middle of no where and provide
			for himself. Firearms do not kill people, the person pulling the
			triggger does that. The presence of a gun for protection or even for
			recreation should never be challanged and if you have a problem with
			guns in Theis country go somewhere else. Thank you

			Imagine a society in which only the police and higher authoritites
			have guns. People are greedy and will overstep their privilages. Even
			though polices officer's duty is to help, their are cops who break the
			law. And what can we do if they're the only ones who have guns?
			Nothing. Also, if the government tried taking over there would be more
			then just one person to stop. Militia would form and revolt. If guns
			were banned it would do nothing to stop crime. A good example of this
			is marijuana. Yea, its illegal says the Federal Government, but just
			about anybody who wants to smoke pot does. People will get a hold of
			guns one way or another so why bann them and waste time and effort
			getting rid of them.

impeach them if we do not like them. it is not a perfect system i
know, but it ensures that no person can take control of our country.
even if somebody did, then do you really think a gun is going to be

has taken over the militia, and do you think that you would win

What I do not understand is why the winning argument for this is 'no,
guns don't kill people', when clearly they are a weapon used for
harming or killing. There is no way a sane person can honestly say
guns are good and the fact they exist is a great way to improve our
planet!' Guns are bad, they kill. However I realise that if there were
a serious offence and someone attacked the police with a gun things
could turn bad quickly. Which is why I have tagged this as 'Keep the
Guns, Change the System'. Perhaps they should change the law and copy
the English where the police have guns in serious conditions but
usually they leave them alone. Any arguments? Any arguments?

Every year 30,000 people die of gun shots in America, and still there
are many states that don’t keep guns illegal. There are people who are
afraid to get shot when they travel there; this is a sad fact. I argue
that guns should be illegal for many reasons. First of all, guns give
a better chance for criminals to commit crimes; knowing that with
knives they don’t stand a chance. Second, there is a greater
percentage, by data, that people are more harmed with guns rather than
protected. Gunshot incidents in school make it all the more clearer
that kids can unintentionally shoot. Finally, if guns are illegal than
it will be harder to get buy a gun and therefore less people will be
murdered.

death rate of just over 10 in 100,000. England outlawed all handguns
and has a 0.6 per 100,000 gun death rate. [1] The facts are pretty
clear that in countries where guns are allowed, more people are shot
and killed. In 1999, there were 28,874 gun-related deaths in the
United States - over 80 deaths every day. In 1999, 58% of all gun
deaths were suicides, and 38% were homicides. Of all suicides, 57%
occurred by firearm. In 2000, 75,685 people (27/100,000) suffered non-
fatal firearm gunshot injuries. What, exactly, is the point of guns?
The fact of the matter is that America has a culture where guns are
OK, and the only thing that is ever going to do is mean a great

the people who think they need guns to protect themselves but, there
are other ways to do that then a gun. Besides that, if guns are
illegal, you don't have to protect yourself against guns anymore,
which will lower the level of violence a lot. And guns don't kill
people? who actually thinks that's true? it's the person who holds the
gun that decides to kill, but it's always the gun that's doing the

Guns should be far more restricted than they are now. We have far
higher murder rates than almost any other first-world country. Yes,
it's important to protect 2nd amendment rights. But they should not be
unrestricted. In Arizona, the Republican led state legislature has
become enamored with a law allowing concealed weapons on every
university campus in the state - the schools cannot ban them. What's
worse, they originally wanted to extend that to the public school
system! I have a number of friends who are good, honorable gun owners.
I know they are very responsible with their weapons. I also have a
friend who is border-line mentally disabled, and was given a concealed
weapons permit. Once, I took him to the local convenience store to buy
him a Coke. When we returned, there was a guy walking toward the
house, with the intention of stealing his bike. "Oh no! I've got my
.45 there!" This nitwit left a loaded .45 in a bike bag, and parked
the bike in the driveway unlocked - instead of leaving it inside the
fenced yard, which was guarded by a Rottweiler and a German Shepard!
Never mind the fact that had he said something, of course he could
have put the freaking thing in the locked house! He's a security
guard, and a few months later he decided to take the gun to work.
Never mind that he's only licensed as an unarmed guard. It's against
the law for him to have a gun with him. Never mind that the company he
worked for didn't have a license for him to have it, either. So what
does he do? Of course! He left the same loaded .45 in his LUNCH BOX,
unguarded on his desk at work, where it was stolen! I have two huge
problems with both these situations: 1. I completely object to being
forcibly made part of a gun battle between someone like this and a
shooter. I know this guy, and he's more likely to have the gun taken
from him and used against him or someone like me, than he ever would
be to defend anyone. 2. People like this unwittingly supply the black
market to street thugs at discount prices no less. His right to a gun
has to be weighed against my right to be secured from his negligence.
Don't involve me in a fantasy some people seem to have that this is
the wild west and every theater and fast food place is the OK Corral.
Responsible gun ownership, please?!

Most objects have the potential to be a threat. A knife sitting on a
kitchen table may be harmless but in the hands of a thief it can be
deadly. Guns have more potential to be dangerous than knives but
simply being dangerous is not grounds for banning an object.

	Overall, a gun in the home is 216 times more likely to be used in self

Yes guns should be banned in America. In the UK, deaths by guns are a
lot lower. The reason is that it's still harder for the average man in
the street to obtain a gun. The American Constitution states "The
right to bear arms" and the Americans seem to feel really strongly
about protecting this right. Obviosly the constitution is held in high
esteem to the Americans, based on their history and pride of
independence. However you can't hold onto values and laws that have
lost their importance or value. At the time of the American
Declaration of Independance, which, I imagine would have led to the
drawing up of the rules in the constitution, life and times were
completely different. Shootings and murder were everywhere, and if I
was George Washington writing a proclamation for a new world, then it
makes perfect sense to give the citizens of this new world, the right
to defend their land, property, and life. And for this reasons
Americans have guns. But, if you can't get hold of one, you can't kill
someone with it. It's a simple argument really, guns kill.

i don't think we should ban all guns, but certainly some. if you want

of a gun other then that. getting one for protection is stupid since
there are many other options you have before resorting to a gun for
protection. think about getting an alarm, moving to a low crime area,
or buying a guard dog. i think guns such as AK-47's are overkill and
should be banned. do you really need a machine gun to kill a little

In England, people have realized that guns just create more violence
and therefore, they have banned them. And it did them good. The US's
murder rate is 15 times higher of that in England. (That's a lot!!!)
Most murders involve guns. The most common argument against banning
guns is that people should be able to defend themselves. But most
likely they would be defending themselves against guns. But if you got
rid of guns, you wouldn't be needing to really defend yourself. Yes
people can get get killed other ways too, but guns are the most common
way, and guns only are really used for violence. It takes a lot of
rage, strength and energy to stab someone, but it only takes a twitch
of a finger to shoot someone. GUNS SHOULD BE BANNED!!!!

Okay i wish there was both sides because to be honest i am doing a
project on this and i really wanna do both sides. we should banned
guns because in the year of 2012 and of course 2011 there have been
many killings, deaths, and shoot outs. shoot outs at SCHOOL! Come on
and im pretty sure there will be many more that's sad and crazy.
anyways, there's been kids dying from guns that either accidently went
off or one is shooting one another. its not so much their fault for
having the gun its for the people who sells CHILDREN Guns illegaly and
i doubt they wont stop because to them that's like their salary, the
money that pays bills. not to long ago a little girl in 3rd grade (i
think, but she was young) got shoot by a little boy because he had a
gun in his bag and it accidently went off when he set his bag down.
kids my age dies like everyday that's scary. and there's people that
will shoot someone for no reason. this is the part that is confusing
but makes sence why i agree to having guns but also shouldn't. people
say we should have guns because i can keep my children safe. i can
protect myself from people that is robbing me. like for real that's
good reasons but you can also kill someone just trying to protect
yourself. (i hate death if you cant tell) so when the police ask you
what happen you'll just say i killed someone because they were robbing
me. like they already got their consequence because you killed them,
so what about your consequence you just killed someone! that's murder!
either if it was an accident, trying to defend your self doesnt matter
i think you should at least get consequences (they prob. do but i just
dont know). like if someone was beating you up and you fight back you
will get in trouble for fighting back. so why is it different from
shooting someone and killing them. Hope you liked i kind of went off
track(: but yeah. By: Porshe' Sturgis 14years old. March.19.2012

please stop guns in the usa help others and help the poor You are
absolutely wrong about the second amendment being put in place to
prevent a British invasion or coup. It was put in place partially to
allow the creation of militias. You're also wrong about guns making
crime rates go higher, take a look at Switzerland. Men there are
required to own automatic weapons and yet they have next to no crime
rate. Their lack of a standing army is what was originally for seen
for the United States, or a system similar. A small standing army to
form the core of a greater force in times of war. That is what the
second amendment implies. Obviously you know little about guns, a
shotgun is probably one of the least threatening weapons to people.
Their limited range for their weight and length makes them impractical
for crime, but perfect for the defense of ones home. The guns aren't
the problem its people and don't start blaming poverty, or education.
Just because you're poor doesn't mean that you have to kill someone to
improve your life. There are many ways to do that. So long as guns
exist people will always find a way to acquire them. By reducing the
number of honest, law abiding citizens with the capability to protect
themselves from these criminals you're asking for a breakdown of
order. But I diverge from the topic at hand. Point is only an idiot
points a gun anywhere near a person they don't want to kill. There's
no such thing as a gun related accident, gun related deaths almost
always are caused by carelessness or stupidity or both.

The british aren't going to invade, so we don't need to protect
ourselves". So when an american enters you're home with intent to
kill, are you going to defend yourself with a fork? I do agree that
most burglary's that occur do not involve a murder or serious injury,
but not all home invasion's are with the intent to remove your
property. If I we're in the position to put my life on the line, or
lose a television, I would rather lose the television. The question is
whether this person is here to steal my property or harm me or my
family. I would rather have the means to protect myself and my family.
If we lived in a perfect world where we didn't have Poverty, Drugs and
Poor Education, then maybe I could see youre point. The fact of the
matter is we don't. When America gets to the point where I can go to
sleep at night, or even go about my daily business and not worry, then
I'll consider getting rid of my gun. Until then, we live in a
dangerous world where people live outside the law and I feel safe
knowing theres an amendment granting me the right to defend myself.

It is morally better to yell and scream at an armed attacker than to
shoot them. Guns in the hands of stupid people are dangerous.....we
should also ban stupid people. Everyone knows that a pregnant woman,
an old person, or a person in a mobile home could excape trouble by
hiding in their bedroom with a criminal in their home and calling the
police who are miles away. Private citizens, who are alone in their
homes, dont need guns, they need to rely on the police, who travel in
groups, have radios, and carry guns. The second amendment says
MILITIAS have the right to carry guns, not private citizens, and that
is why the militias are there to protects us and are composed
of....private citizens. Guns are extremely dangerous, and thats why
schools which are gun free zones as are churches are not targeted by
violent criminals while guns shows and reenactments are replete with
criminal violence. Who needs a gun when you can dive under your bed
and be safe from a criminal? A criminal might take you gun and use it
on you....especially if it is better than the one he is carrying and
since he can get to you before you pull the trigger. Columbine was
safe because it was a gun free zone and the guys who did the shooting
were simply law abiding citizens who happened to have nasty guns.
Besides, all was well once they called the cops. Having a gun in the
home of a private citizen who takes it out now and then for target
shooting is more dangerous than a car in the hands of a citizen who
drinks himself silly every weekend.

The right to own a weapon is not, nor should it be, a fundamental
right. If there were no consequences to gun ownership, I would
certainly support allowing all guns everywhere. But there are
consequences. Guns kill people just like fists kill people, except it
is much easier to erroneously kill/injure with a gun. I dispute the
claim of self-defense rights. It is indisputably safer to not own a
gun than to own a gun, save for the rare case when the area is so
dangerous that using the gun to save oneself is statistically more
likely than using it to kill oneself/others, on accident or otherwise.
And all of these special cases exist only because guns exist in the
first place. Remove them all and violence drops dramatically (after
all, there is no such thing as a drive-by knife fight). The mission to
remove guns from the streets is akin to the drive to promote world
peace. In fact, they are essentially the same thing. Although
promoting peace can have consequences (often, it creates conflict) the
less war there is the better. It is the same with guns. The unique
factor that makes guns, like war, so worth fighting against is that
they cause significant collateral damage. They fuel drug cartel
violence, they contribute to accidental deaths and suicides, and they
often kill innocent bystandards. Other weapons? Not so much. The
attempt to ban guns begins at the supreme court. The 2nd ammendment
must be re-interpreted under its primary intention, "militia."
Militia, in today's speak, means locally stationed military, or just
military. If reinterpreted correctly, this law does not protect gun
owners. Next, the federal government would coordinate with states to
completely eliminate all production of new guns in the country, and
ban the importation. This would stifle the supply to almost zero.
Finally, gun buyback programs and phased-in laws against gun ownership
would slowly remove the remaining guns. This would require a lot of
effort, and a lot of redneck outrage, but it would all be worth it in
the long run. To the few people every year who get attacked by people
and theroretically could have saved themselves if they had a gun (and
also the assailant did not have a gun (and the victim could not have
just defended with a knife)), sorry. You will die, but for the benefit
of millions of victims and victims' families. I conclude with this
statement: the less opportunities we have to kill, the less we do.

I can hardly understand how this is not obvious, you have lost an
unknown number of normal people today at a cinema screening. That
should not be allowed to happen so easily, how can America let it? I
have seen comments in the NEWS FEED which suggest that this is not a
suprise for the area! My mind boggles, if someone is shot it should be
a suprise! If you did not do everything humanly possible to prevent
the possiblility that someone with the capacity to kill could have
hold of a weapon with that capability then that is ridiculous. If the
sacrifice you have to make is to hand over a gun which you cant prove
you need for any good reason enough to keep it then that is a small
price if it might save one life. The right to arms is out of date,
just because people have them already is a weak excuse, maybe it will
take 20 years to get it in order but every year will be a bit safer
than the last. If you have a gun in your bag then that suggests you
would consider using it, taking a life is a big deal, what if you
missed, shot in a struggle through a window, or across the road. Guns
kill because if point your fingers and say bang nobody dies. If you
have a gun to protect yourself its a good bet that your attacker has
one too, maybe if they were banned then they wouldnt have one... or so
much confidence. Hand in your weapons because every time someone is
shot you know it might just have been prevented.

The easier it is to get hold of guns, the greater the likelihood of
people being fatally shot. I realise that criminals and mentally
afflicted people are unable to own guns legally, but since you can't
predict who is going to commit a crime or develop a mental illness in
the future, that doesn't offer much protection if somebody suddenly
has a psychotic episode and goes on a killing spree.

I find America's obsession with guns fascinating. Because the
founders of your country wrote a document hundreds of years ago
stating that everybody has the right to bear arms means that this
document cannot be challenged to suit a modern era many years later?
What makes this Constitution infallible other than how much importance
is placed on its merits by the people? No single document or set of
laws is infallible. Basic logic. The fact is there is a strong
correlation between legal guns and higher homicide rates. More
Americans are killed by guns every year than all other developed
countries combined. No problems with guns I hear you say? Also, inb4
"some countries where it is legal to obtain guns have low crime
rates". Using a few examples to justify a larger picture painted by
the correlation between gun ownership and higher homicide rates is
intellectually dishonest debate fodder. And quite frankly, I am sick
of hearing the tired old phrase "guns don't kill people - people do".
Yeah, people kill people. But what are my chances of going on a murder
spree using a screwdriver vs a loaded gun? Idiots.

I my point of view guns shoul be benned not only in America but in
other countries also. Guns should be used only in military. Let us
think why nowadays there are a lot of terrorists, of course because of
guns and other veapons. They became available to a society and imagine
how many families have suffered from it, how many mothers have losen
their child? but anyway they MUST be used in military only. despite
the fact that they can damage someones life guns could be the only way
to protect us,what the military is succesfuly doing.

Guns have the sole intention to kill people. Rather than this guns
aren't used for anything else. While committing a murder with a knife
or a bat is considered a misconduct, guns where only designed to kill.
Knives and bats were developed for other causes rather than killing.
But guns aren't used in any other way. In addition guns are even more
lethal than knives because one can accidentally kill someone due to
uncontrollable firing. This especially applies to assault rifles and
submachine guns that fire multiple rounds per pulling the trigger.
Where as with a knife only one person can be targeted. Another point
for the gun ban is that people with criminal intentions can easily get
access to guns and weapons. America has seen this during the past 20
years the gang violence the frequent gun-related homicides and the
brutal massacres such as columbine, Virginia Tech and now New Town
Connecticut. By giving these people (or any people at all) access to
these weapons multiple people can be killed in just a matter of
seconds and most importantly guns can be acquired legally. But for
what cause? What could you possibly need a gun for? For hunting but
only with a license and any deliberate murder would be considered a
misconduct because hunting rifles where intended to kill animals and
that is a legitimate cause for killing. But since cannibalism is
extremely scarce people say they need guns for protection. But from
what? There's the police there's the FBI that protect but just normal
residents why do they need guns. Every single time people have a
conflict they don't try to peacefully solve the problem. A lot of them
would just go crazy, grab their gun and start shooting at the other
person they were having their conflict with. If they wouldn't have
guns they might think two more times before reverting to the gun.
People always think violence is the answer I can assure you it isn't
and those that think violence isn't caused by guns but by people they
should know that guns foster this violence and even intensify it on a
catastrophic scale. The worst part of all is that because of the gun
sales and the simplicity of acquiring a weapon, criminal organizations
are heavily benefiting from this as well. The Sinaloa cartel and
various street gangs can simply order people to purchase weapons for
them. If the opportunity weren't there it would be much more difficult
for criminal organizations to acquire them. However criminal
organizations can still smuggle weapons and get assault weapons but
the ban on weapons could lower the murder rate and hinder
organizations from bulking up with annihilating firepower. We should
act fast and realize that we are protecting ourselves from the same
thing that is supposed to protect us. Guns are wrong and we need to
find an alternative method. The constant killing has got to stop!

As a human I am disgusted as to the fact that people still want to
buy guns despite the amount of death they cause. First let me say I am
not against the sale of select weapons for hunting and farmers but no
one else needs weapons and certainly no one needs fully automatic
carbines or 12 gauge shotguns, why would anyone need weapons that are
close to and are in some cases military grade?? The line "guns don't
kill people, people do" is quite ridiculous as an argument for gun
sales since it is "people" that the guns are being sold to!! It is
just a case of prevention, remove guns being so easily accessible and
you then decrease the gun crime and remove the need for guns to defend
yourself. This is common sense, it's the reason why no countries are
now allowed to make nuclear weapons, to say people deserve guns do
defend themselves is to say places like Iran and North Korea should be
able to make nuclear weapons to defend themselves and if you think
that then clearly something is wrong

I believe we should ban guns in America because it's time that we

when it's pretty obvious that more people are killed within the safety
of their own homes due to accidents or domestic altercations. I agree
with Pres. Obama that the safety of our children must always comes
first and has priority over our so-called constitutional rights to own
a gun. We need to stop ENABLING serial killers who want to go down in
a blaze of glory while taking innocent children, men, and women down

The second amendment is made for a militia that would work to protect
the communities. If the fathers of the nation would know what they
have done they would decide do not create the "free" America. There is
no freedom that have been made to kill people and destroy the life.
The fathers of the American democracy developed the freedoms to make a
country of individuals with high spirit and good will. Is it good will
to keep tens of guns at home to protect from everybody - That thinking
is much closer to a thinking of a psicho than to a thinking of a
normal men. There are organizations that make a lot of money making
American psichos. The true is that even if you had your two or three
guns in a massacres you wouldnt be able to use any of those without to
take a good part of the mass killing. When in such case the police
arrive you will be more likely to be killed as offendor that to be
greeted as a protector. And what is the result at the end - Just a
scene of a stupid bloody Holliwood movie. The true is that the only
way to make America safer is to remove the guns completely from the
American home and American streets. If owing a gun will be a criminal
act all those gangs will be put in prisons for less than a week. The
mad guys with mad plans will be put in the hospitals for a week. And
the country will become safe and nice place where you can walk even
after 9PM. Look at the countires in the world. Is America the safest
one or not and why. Having Senators aand Rep.'s talking that the gun
would protect a teacher in a school or a child - isn't it a sign of
madness. Those guys for sure shouldnt be let having guns. If they are
so mad how mad would be their kids. If there is a fine if you let a
kid to smoke or drink before the age of 18 or 21 isn't it stupid to
allow the same kid to learn to shoot with guns on aim. And of course
the question comes - did God say - not kill (there was nothink like -
not drink or not smoke). Or the gun lobists think that the God will
work for their lobbies too. Is not a shame or fun for sure - it is a
stupidity and fearlessness from the true but the punishment comes till
the live time. The God is good but doesn't forget. So weird was to
hear religious people stating that the guns are not the issue. They
for sure are the issue. The issue are the man and women that believe
only in their guns and don't know how mental sick they are.

True, people kill people, no guns, but guns allow a person to kill
many people in a short time. if that nut didn't have a gun, how kids
do you think hw wouldv'e been able to kill with a knife or club before
being subdued? A gun gives that person the feeling like he is
invincible, which makes it easier for him to go on a killing spree. If
he wasn't able to get a gun, all those kids would be alive today,
except maybe one. If gun owners would think of that, instead of there
own selfish desires to have a gun, alot of children would still be
alive today. Reports show that a small percentage of gun owners
actually use a gun to defend themselves, there are more killed with a
gun, than those using a gun to protect themselves, they cain't say
it's used for selfdefense. with all the guns in the hands of so called
law abiding citizens, why are so many children massacred today? where
are they using there guns to protect? Gun owners don't want to give up
there guns because of there selfish desire to own one. They want to
say "what about my rights", whats more important, there desire to own
something they will rarely use, or those childrens rights that was
killed to grow up? They don't need it for food, thats what stores are
for. I guess they just like to shoot helpless beings to see blood,
what a minute, that sounds like that nut who shot all those kids!
Maybe we really do need to outlaw guns.

While I think it would be too soon to "ban guns in America"
outright.. I firmly believe we need to ask ourselves is a gun in
everyone's hand really the world we want to live in? Guns need not be
banned right away.. but I do believe our goal should be cultivating a
world where we don't need guns. That's our goal. That is different
from what is really taking place but that is our goal. Life and the
preservation of Life is the most important thing. Our mission should
be to preserve life. There is an unrealistic feeling of "control" that
a gun gives you. Basically blinding people to think that somehow they
can be above the natural Godly chaos of the world. IF someone really
wants to kill you, there's not much of a chance of you defending
yourself. If you believe in a higher power there is no reason to be
scared. If it the spirit within us all is collective than you really
don't have anything to fear but fear itself. As far as one post
stating if we all had money and the basic essentials than there would
be no reason for guns... I think this sentiment is spot on. NOBODY
ever discusses the real reason criminals have guns. There are too many
to name, but they all usually go back to an unhealthy relationship to
money and greed in our society, the paper chase. I'm not saying we
need to be communists. Even ancient Rome fed it's peasants in the
street. There is a civic as well as a spiritual responsibility we have
towards mankind. We are all on the same side here. Our individual
salvation depends on our collective salvation. You can't keep killing
the problem. You must educate and preserve life. On a small scale guns
could be replaced with Tasers and other close range defense
mechanisms. Guns initial purpose was to defend against the tyranny of
government by forming militia. Which I would argue a gun or semi
automatic won't do much against our current military. The 2nd
Amendment is dated to say the least. It was meant for defending
against Indians and the British. I'm pretty sure the peaceful
education of our enemies and ourselves has turned these foes into our
brothers. The world is more educated than ever... and there are social
networking sites and the internet which can disseminate information
faster than ever. We can either be part of a global arms race and kill
ourselves or we can seek virtue, truth, and education in order to live
in harmony. I will add that GUNS aren't really the issue at hand. It's
a disconnection to our spirituality. And not a religious spirituality,
a mankind spirituality that connects us all. If we really loved all
life (not liked) but loved life we would be in favor of preserving it
and educating the world to preserve it. Guns are just a reminder of
our mortal beings and immortal souls.

Yes it should. Why do people need guns when leaving in such a
protected place. in Japan here, the place is calming and not attacks
can be heard, why not drop down those guns and make a world the
calming place. The gun laws are outdated I myself am not American, but
In my opinion guns should be banned, or have very strict laws placed
on them. I know the other side goes on about having "a right to bare
arms", which is all well and good, but having studied american
history, it is easy to see that the main reason guns and possibly the
creed "a right to bare arms" itself existed as America was an
incredibly lawless place at one time, and so people needed to have
their own means of protection. But we're in the 21st century now,
leave protection to those who's jobs it is to protect people, people
who are well-trained like police officers etc. Simply, America's
obsession with guns is little more than paranoia and a fear of change,
and while some individuals may offer compelling arguments of why the
law should stay, it's undeniable that a majority are simply afraid of
change.

gun and killed them. 3. It's outdated. Seriously, when this law was
written the were no automatic machine guns, the guns were heavy and
hard to use, Native Americas were still attacking, and Slavery was
still legal. 4. Humans "Flight or Fight" response. You're more likely
to defend yourself with a kitchen knife than running all the way to
your safe and doing the combination, you'd be a goner. 5. Guns kill
more people than any other weapon, and are a lot harder to defend
against. You way way more likely to survive one stab wound physically
unharmed than a gun shot wound. Plus, you still have a chance to
defend yourself against a knife, how do you defend yourself against a

To me this is a clear cut decision and I believe wholeheartedly they
should be banned for many reasons actually. Contrary to popular belief
they do actually kill people imagine if that shooter didn't have a gun
and had to walk around using brunt force to kill people how many less
victims there would be involved. How many lives banning guns could
save. What kind of world do we live in that a young adult can go and
buy a gun or be allowed access to something as dangerous as a gun yet
god forbid if they drink alcohol or even watch porn before they're
allowed. Others say it's a way of defending yourself yet surely there
are plenty of other less bloodthirsty methods to protect oneself from
attack as opposed to carrying around a gun. The people behind the guns
kill these people not the guns themselves yet we are the society and
world that allow these mentally unstable criminals reek havoc on our
world with guns but oh don't worry because they're a criminal they
were always going to kill someone maybe we should be profiling other
peoples weird impulses and needs to own a gun what thrill do you get
from this? Honestly it baffles me. Now i'm fully expecting the 2nd
Amendment argument but that was put into place in the 1700's we're in
the 21st century wake up people. Not only that but The 2nd Amendment
and the "Right to bear arms" was only approved to prevent others from
entering property and committing treason. A time when the "police"
were not so wide spread as it is today. So surely we no longer need
weapons such as guns. Not only do I believe guns should be banned for
moral reasons but also the statistics back me up In 2012 the number of
gun related violent crimes per 100,000 was 10.2 or one per every
10,000 people, which based on the current population means that almost
32,000 Americans were gun crime victims. Now imagine if there were no
gun's? Better yet imagine f that was your family member a victim of a
school shooting or a criminal shooting them simply because they could
get their hands so easily on a gun.

To argue one side or the other, in terms in single events, is silly.
The argument is death, because of the nature of a gun. Rarely is it so
one sided. Why do people fixate on one topic? To focus on one issue as
the core is illogical. 1) First note, yes, guns can kill people, but
ultimately people kill people. Basic logic. This is an argument of
purpose and existence. Just because something exists doesn't mean it
has purpose, and if an object has purpose it has existence. What is
the purpose of the firearm? Many. Yes, killing is one of them, but
there are so many others (for example, the enjoyment of shooting large
pumpkins...and yes, I do). Equally so, I could argue that as a human,
you were created to breed and kill on the whole in order to survive as
the fittest, but modern theories and cognition seem to provide a
greater degree of purpose to humanity. Of course, most of it is BS. 2)
Equating lower crime rates due to the ban of guns is absurd. Japan has
a peaceful society because after World War 2, and as terms of their
surrender, many impositions were put on them. As such, the country
turned inward and began the foundation of modern Japan. Make no
mistake, guns or not, the Japanese were not exactly the epitome of
peace up until recent times. The idea of self is not priority to the
Japanese. Subsequently, this level of stress in Japan has given them
the highest suicide rate in the world. Death by gun? probably not.
Death by , sure! Key topic here, death. The UK with it's gun ban has
seen a healthy increase in knife violence. From what I also read, gun
crimes actually went up as well (yes, the nasty black market). But if
you look at most statistics, the majority of these crimes are
concentrated in heavily populated areas (this seems to corroborate
with worldwide trends.). See my argument #1...people kill people,
especially when you cram them in a small, stinky space. Human nature.
Take away one thing, we'll either find it another way or find a
substitute. 3) The Constitution. The right to bear arms has been
beaten to death. The 2nd amendment was created in order to have a
readily available militia, amongst a other minor things. Home defense?
sure, why not. The gun nuts (and I do own guns) tend to use this as a
giant hammer, crying to the call of freedom. Ridiculous. Get over it.
It's ok to say "I shoot guns because it's fun and makes me happy". No
shame in that. The ultimate issue is a Pandoras box, which actually
applies to all kinds of ideas and objects. An idea or object is
released to the world, and we want to tuck it away never to be seen
again. This is setting everyone up for failure. Conceptually, it's
like making a statement to a group of people, then retracting it...not
exactly the solution. Guns should be legal, but reform should take
place. Emphasis higher education as a requirement (as in mandatory
classes), mandatory firing instruction (as in, mandatory classes), and
mandatory testing of such (book and field) before you can purchase a
firearm. Education people, that is the key to anything. Will this
solve the occasional gun crazies out there? no. But if you are
spending your time worrying about the typical Columbine or Virginia
Tech stories, get over it. You're more likely to die from a car
collision than getting shot. Yes, I'll hear "You say that because it
didn't happen to you", or "your wasn't shot at the grocery store". You
are correct, and it's a luxury I have. It's called objectivity.

Maybe the government of USA should not prohibit all weapons. First
the government should get rid of nuclear weapons. United Nations just
deal with this problem at the moment. Kazakhstan leads the program.
More than 40 nations, including Kazakhstan, met in Washington in 2010
for the first summit and again in Seoul in March 2012. "When the Cold
War ended and the Soviet Union dissolved, Kazakhstan inherited a vast
nuclear weapons infrastructure that included 1,410 nuclear warheads.
President Nazarbayev made a “courageous and monumental decision” to
remove all of the nuclear weapons from the country", Limage said.
Limage is the deputy assistant secretary of state in the State
Department’s Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation.
Limage said the United States and Kazakhstan have been working
together and with others to combat illicit trafficking in nuclear and
radiological materials through the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear
Terrorism. I take the view that it is a global problem, not only in
USA and also world over. I believe that people are able to protect the
world against nuclear weapons. “The United States has taken bold steps
toward nuclear disarmament,” Limage said. It is my view this is the
most important

There are essentially two arguments for the ownership of/legality of
guns in American (outside of the second amendment). 1) Protection -
The argument suggests that guns protect us from dangerous individuals.
The problem is that WE ARE the dangerous individuals. From accidents,
to insanity, to alcohol or drug-fueled violence, we are the ones doing
this damage. The best mode of protection is the removal of firearms
from society. 2) Entertainment/sport - Shooting is fun. I love it.
Skeet, target, and hunting are fun pastimes. I was trained as a boy to
properly care for, handle, and shoot a fire arm. I was 10 years old
when I shot my first .22 and I was hooked. I would love to pass these
skills onto my son, but not at the cost of so much death and
destruction caused by the improper use of guns. I would rather pass on
a safer society. I've heard all of the arguments and both sides are
certainly passionate about their beliefs. Here are some of my
rebuttals to common counter-arguments. Guns don't kill people, people
kill people: absolutely true, but guns allow people to kill people
with greater efficiency, which is not necessarily a good thing outside
of the battlefield. If guns are outlawed, only outlaws would have
guns: Actually, not true. Outlaws and law enforcement would have guns.
Criminals will find ways to get guns: True, but the supply will be
much lower the demand much higher, thus making it more expensive, thus
more difficult, to get a gun.

Guns should be banned because they are not needed in any domestic
issue. The second ammendment was put in place because of fear that the
british might invade america again or take control of the government.
if this were the case the people would need weapons to defend
themselves and regain america. The british aren't going to invade so
we don't need to protect our selves. even in the this day and age
america remains increadible safe compared to many other nations. we
have no close enemies. if a major army were to attack us a few men
with pistols or shotguns wouldn't do much against a soldier with an
ak47 or tanks or bombers. Guns in America just make it easier for
crimes to be committed. Some guns should never be considered allowed
and this includes all semi automatic weapons as well as shotguns.
Poverty, drugs, and lack of education are the reasons people turn to
guns to kill. guns give you power to take life and should not be
allowed to float around so that our students or citizens can use them
against one another. Guns may not kill people on their own but they
greatly facilitate the killing of people and their sole purpose unlike
most knives and axes is to kill. if we are allowed to carry a tool
which sole purpose is to kill then purposely or accidentally we will
harm or kill someone and that risk can't be allowed to exist.

	You are absolutely wrong about the second amendment being put in
	place to prevent a British invasion or coup. It was put in place
	partially to allow the creation of militias. You're also wrong about
	guns making crime rates go higher, take a look at Switzerland. Men
	there are required to own automatic weapons and yet they have next to
	no crime rate. Their lack of a standing army is what was originally
	for seen for the United States, or a system similar. A small standing
	army to form the core of a greater force in times of war. That is what
	the second amendment implies. Obviously you know little about guns, a
	shotgun is probably one of the least threatening weapons to people.
	Their limited range for their weight and length makes them impractical
	for crime, but perfect for the defense of ones home. The guns aren't
	the problem its people and don't start blaming poverty, or education.
	Just because you're poor doesn't mean that you have to kill someone to
	improve your life. There are many ways to do that. So long as guns
	exist people will always find a way to acquire them. By reducing the
	number of honest, law abiding citizens with the capability to protect
	themselves from these criminals you're asking for a breakdown of
	order. But I diverge from the topic at hand. Point is only an idiot
	points a gun anywhere near a person they don't want to kill. There's
	no such thing as a gun related accident, gun related deaths almost
	always are caused by carelessness or stupidity or both.

		expert i agree but i also know that shotguns arn't the most dangerous

		shotguns because i feel that there is no justification for owning one
		not that i thought they were very dangerous. I'm not saying poor
		people resort to guns what i am saying is that poverty destroys
		people's lives and creates an atmosphere of fear. There are poor
		people who are living the best they can with what society has thrown
		at them. criminals or gangs might try to recruit the poor since they
		say they offer a better life. because of society the poor might feel
		that they don't have much hope and that being in a criminal
		organization might help to raise them. i understand that most of the
		poor don't do this but there are a few, especially in a city. a large
		reason for our higher violence rates is our society and maybe not the
		presence of guns alone but guns make it easier. just because a group
		in one area are able to control gun violence(like Switzerland) does
		not mean that a group somewhere else is. "There's no such thing as a

		carelessness or stupidity or both." and thus wouldn't that be an
		accident? maybe only an idiot does point a gun near someone they don't
		want to kill there are still a few idiots in this world with access to
		guns. i understand your points about self defense and i think it is
		the only and strongest reason for not banning guns yet what guns are
		you talking about? do you think we should be allowed to own semi-
		automatics? a lot of the recent gun deaths in the news were when
		people were not at home. such as at Virgina Tech, do you think people
		should be able to carry guns to class or in public? what i'm trying to
		say is if you have a shotgun at home yet are confronted when you're
		away from home how much use is that shotgun? lastly i talked about
		education and poverty because most of the criminals are people who
		have been treated not well by society. there are those high level
		gangs that did well but where did they begin what reason did they have

			Militias still have their place, the National Guard is in a sense a
			militia. It's composed of soldiers who train regularly but are not
			professionals. Historically it was not the Continental Army that won
			the American Revolution but the militias that fought alongside the
			army. I would argue that if you are pointing a gun at someone it is
			not an accident if the gun goes off and kills the person you are
			pointing it at, period. The only restriction on whether a person can
			own a gun should be passing a gun safety course. A shotgun has many
			uses, and in many ways a shotgun would be a better self-defense weapon
			than a handgun it has significantly more stopping power and is much
			harder to conceal. If you have your shotgun with you then it's a lot
			of help. There is a significant number of people in the US that carry
			weapons in their cars for just the sort of situation you describe.
			That is also the reasoning behind obtaining a concealed carry permit.
			Finally you bring up societies mistreatment of people. I honestly
			believe that people's lack of education and even to some extent
			poverty is more often than not a result of their own failings. I would
			be remiss to say that all poverty was something that those stricken by
			it brought it upon themselves but many poverty stricken people
			perpetuate their status. More importantly a lack of scholarly
			education or wealth is no excuse for going on a crime spree. In short
			I'll fall back on the tried and true motto, "Guns don't kill people,
			people kill people." It's hard to argue with that logic, modern guns
			have so many safeguards built in that it is not often that they go off
			without someone pulling the trigger and never if it's not loaded.

	Shot guns are used for many different application a few of which are
	bird hunting like pheasant or ducks, they can also be used for trap
	and skeet shooting. Another thing shotguns have a maximum shot
	distance of 30 yards so they aren't that good of a weapon. Also semi-
	automatic weapons have various uses and when you are hunting fast
	animals you want to be able to take as many shots as possible without
	having to cock the gun. Another point is that a gun is a tool and the
	person is the one who kills someone not the gun. And it is now
	required to take firearm safety to purchase or use a gun and also 80%
	of guns used in crimes are bought illegally according to the FBI.

Yes, guns should be banned. Guns provide a trigger for any violent
activity in the society, like the Virginia University incident. In our
normal life, we have a bad notion for a particular person and wish to
kill him if he comes forward some day. This happens with EVERYONE. He
might be our naughty neighbour or prankster classmate. We often say "
I will rip him into pieces if he argues again, some day". Presence of
guns around us just provide an acceleration to this kind of a thinking
and encourages us to act upon him and kill that person. So, guns
should be banned forever.

	You state that guns are a tool that increases the ease with which a

	rage and utilize the tool that they carry for protection of themselves
	and others to kill someone? Aren't those feelings of rage and hate we
	feel internally slightly exaggerated? Would any sane, responsible
	person be able to act externally upon irritation, even with a tool
	readily available, to kill someone? I think not. Serial killers and
	criminals buy their tools to kill. Responsible gun owners, the ones
	that follow all laws regulating gun ownership, will not use the guns
	they acquired for a wholly distinct and opposite purpose to kill or
	hurt others.

Of course guns kill people, but that doesn't mean that they should be
banned. Knives kill people, cars kill people, Big Macs kill people,
but should they be banned as well? First of all, it would be
impossible to ban guns and expect that they would all be taken off the
street. They are too prolific in America now and there's no turning
back. Second, guns serve a great purpose in many cases, people just
need to be educated on proper gun safety. Additionally, we should do
more to ensure the people who are getting guns are capable of handling
them and are not likely to go kill someone with it.
[Posted by Time2Golf at 2008-05-08T19:47:01+00:00 - Side: No, guns don't kill people.]

	Well a gun is different than big macs and knives, because a gun was
	solely designed to kill things. And when someone says guns don't kill
	people, people do, that's like saying pencils don't draw, people do.
	You draw with a pencil. You kill with a gun. It would be impossible to
	get rid of guns. Of course it would be a bad thing because people love
	their guns for hunting, killing, etc. If your "great purpose" of guns
	is death, than yes, they do serve a purpose. It's my personal belief
	that violence and hate only results in more violence and hate. If
	America stopped killing people, no one would hate us. The two reasons
	why people use guns in America: 1. Get things like money, power,
	respect (kill people, hold up stores, stuff like that) 2. Protect us
	from each other because we want money, power, etc. If we all had equal
	money, power, and respect, there wouldn't be any competition,
	therefore no hate, no greed, etc. We can outlaw guns all we want, but
	we're always gonna find ways to kill people. You gotta attack the root
	of the emotion that makes people want to use guns to make people
	realize gun's won't get any real work done.

			Houston, your argument is that a gun is a tool and therefore isn't
			responsible for all the killings. But your point really breaks down
			when you say that if people didn't have guns they would kill with
			other things. While it is true that one person COULD kill another with
			a pencil, the fact is that it is extremely improbable for that to
			actually happen. The fact is that a firearm ban across the board ,
			except for certain restricted numbers of police officers, would mean
			far fewer killings. The mass killings that have become such a stable
			feature of US life would simply stop. You can argue about the
			feasibility of different ways of approaching a ban, but you can't
			sustain that an outright ban wouldn't reduce the number of killings
			dramatically. It is a demonstrable fact that a gun ban results in
			fewer killing. To dispute that is to be on very poor terms with the
			truth. I'm not a religious man, but I like v8, book 3, chapter 2,
			Timothy: He who will not admit the truth cannot be admitted as a true
			believer. Something like that. The point is that the truth isn't
			negotiable all the time. Sometimes you're either admitting the truth

		Removing guns from house hold is the worse thing you can do. Let me
		tell you exactly why as a Information Security Engineer (info sec / IT
		sec ). 1) Law abiding citizen will obey the law. Regardless if you
		want guns or not, criminals have ways to find one and kill you. 2)
		Guns equalize the situation where cops will take 5 minutes minimum to
		bring some body bags to your house. You either want to use that body
		bag or you don't. 3) Guns in America was not meant for hunting as a
		primary purpose. It is your second amendment right / duty to have one
		as our founding fathers have seen how government abuses its power to
		fellow citizens. Government should serve people, not the other way
		around. 4) People kill people , not tools kill people. You say all you
		want that these equipment make it easier for bad people to do harmful
		things. However, would you also want to get rid of chances for law
		abiding citizen to defense themselves. If you say the cops can do it
		then you are delusional. They don't have the jurisdiction to even
		search you or run to your house to do things on your property. Go find
		out about the law. 5) Countries that have extremely strict gun laws
		don't really work well either. Japan still has high crime rates, they
		just hide their news. People still kill each other in many different
		ways. 6) I do agree with fully automatic weapons can be ridiculous
		since you cannot hit anything accurately and should just spread the
		harm. However, having a regular semi-automatic firearms should not be
		excluded in any state or the country. I suggest you go learn about
		firearms really well before you say stuff. 7) Law enforcement do agree
		that black rifles do not create crimes. Crimes were made by people who
		can't afford to have anything. They purchased cheap crappy firearms in
		black market anyway. All can all. I know that the bad guys will go to
		your house not mine for sure. Why? Because I am ready to defend myself
		and my family for the right of life and freedom of speech. Do you like
		Commie countries? You can go to China and see how that feels. Educate
		your children about firearms and proper manner in society is the key.
		Firearms are not the problem. US government themselves deals more than
		any other agencies in the world. Go figure!

		You go find them? Most of the good ones aren't even in government

		resulting in uncivilization and no rules/laws for citizens to follow.
		If people made rules, they would have more power, resulting in a big
		jolt for the economy and the state of everyday activities. And last,
		if people had equal respect, we would have no-one to aspire to be
		like, no idol for us to follow the path of. We would be the same in a
		way. Also, it is impossible to keep everyone equally respected due to

		elevate your level of respect given from others. Overall, I agree that

	What are the purpose of guns? To kill, self-defense maybe. They have

	I mean sure you have to be open minded when it come to this big topic,
	guns don’t kill people the people do, however if you take away the
	guns from the people they become harmless, even with other weapons.
	Guns aren’t the only weapons out there but they are still the most

	school shootings are so common in America because teens have easy
	access to guns, I mean in some parts of America you can go to your

	in America won’t go down if guns were banned, or at least less
	manufactured and harder to come by. And trying to get rid of the
	problem by teaching people how to use guns safely is not giving a
	solution to this entire problem because weapons are gonna be weapons
	and most people won’t even care for these regulations. Just like some
	people won’t care if guns were to be banned. Guns banned or not it’s
	up to the nation to decide weather this is an issue that will be
	resolved or just continue being an issue. Now some people would argue
	that guns are not to blame if not gang culture and lots of other

	Which of course, in order to remove such a government, would require
	not just pistols and other personal weaponry but at least RPGs and
	SAMs. I wonder whether (wish) he would have restricted it (the 2nd
	amendment) to contemporary weaponry of his time, that is: "muskets
	(36+ inches long) and single shot pistols". But now I am not 100% for

THE SECOND AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION The right to
keep and bear arms . I, for one, am happy to know that I live in a
democratic nation that has a fail safe built into it. If it were to
fail, be over run by a tyrant or whatever the case, if it were to
fail, I would have a fighting chance, and so would my peers. I think
disturbing the constitution is a bad idea, especially when we're
talking about something like the 2nd amendment. If you touch the
constitution, and at the same time, strip the people of it's property,
and the property of which could help protect them in dire situations,
you're going to have a reason to amend the constitution again because
there will be a revolt. You know what I mean? You are changing the
game, and then you are making it to where it's harder to keep fair if
they wanted to change it again, and on top of all of that, it's not a
belief that's being taken from them, like the belief of freedom, it's
a material possession that has the power to defend itself, while in
the right hands. Tobacco, which I am all too familiar with, was
responsible for 18.1% of deaths in the U.S. in year 2000. 435,000
deaths in 2000 compared to firearm related deaths at 29,573 in 2001.
Look at the difference there! 405,427 more people died by smoking than
being shot... What do cigarettes do to protect the citizens from each
other or the government? I would have to say, only calm one down a
little for a short amount of time and make their fight weaker and more
difficult to endure. If we're going to do anything concerning the
second amendment, it should be to teach gun safety in classes as a
sort of D.A.R.E. like program. Just because we teach people about
drugs doesn't mean they'll seek them out, this should be the same with
firearms. I do think that we need to keep guns off of the streets, but
this isn't a gun issue, it's a fairly complex societal issue.

				And that my friend, is why Vietnam was lost. The Guerrillas were

				Moreover, the American armed forces is a largely offensive unit,
				indeed they are trained to deal with hostile environments, rather than

				in insugency. Also, the whole point of a militant revolt is to avoid

					prepared because of what they learned in Vietnam and far more
					knowledgeable of the terrain. Also now they have far better
					intelligence technology than during the Vietnam war. Before Vietnam
					and Korea the American armed forces did not have to deal with a solely
					guerrilla war and thus were not as prepared as they are now. Lastly,
					no matter if the rebelling side is using peaceful means or armed as it
					appears you are supporting, there will be excessive bloodshed. Yes
					America lost Vietnam(and around 60,000 people) but the Vietnamese lost
					more than a million troops and civilians at least (I'm only counting
					deaths). They were less trained and they had weapons but that did
					nothing to reduce the amount of losses that they endured.

			you think that our weapon's technology has increased by then? the

			own people, and i would hope that our military would be patriotic
			enough to disobey orders to attack their own country but the US gov
			knows America better than it knows any other nation. also god forbid

			areas, because who would retaliate? the Afghanistan war against the
			soviets was lost on their part because they had an awful plan and
			didn't properly prepare for the war and the afghan forces had
			assistance from US and the CIA as well as US weapons and money. To
			best defeat you enemy you need to understand your enemy, America
			didn't understand its enemies as well as it should have and that has

			since it isn't new info. i do agree however that poverty and lack of

Not too long ago I would have, without hesitation said yes. But given
the drift in this country to more and more centralization of power in
the presidency I am not so sure. I wonder about forces such as
Blackwater; is this destined to be a private force of the executive?
What if McCain is elected? He believes in 'winning the war' on
terrorism. I believe he will naturally seek to exert increased control
over security to the detriment of constitutional safeguards of
liberty. It may take ordinary citizens, armed, to ultimately defend
our Constitution. Our Founding Fathers fought against linger odds. It
reminds of something I once read --- what if every Jew in Hitler's
Germany killed one SS troop as he came to arrest him? The number of
Jews vastly outnumbered the German SS.

Gun control laws simply don't work. Just look at the violent crime
rates of areas with strict gun control laws, such as Washington D.C.
and the U.K. (both of which have gun bans). Then compare it to areas
with less gun control laws, such as Texas and Arizona (where concealed
carry permits are fairly easy to obtain). The difference is huge
because criminals are far less likely to commit a crime if they think
that the victim could be armed. Their was also a study (I don't have
the link handy) that showed that the majority of violent crimes
involving guns, the gun that was used by the criminal was obtained
illegally. That's what criminals do, they break the law. If someone is
really going to commit a crime with a gun, then why would they choose
to obey any gun control laws? I believe that Thomas Jefferson said it
best when he said, "Laws that forbid the carrying of arms . . . disarm
only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes .
. . Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the
assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides,
for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an
armed man."

I've been on both sides of this argument and I can certainly
sympathize with the respective positions. I've always found it
interesting that liberal argument on gun control is seen to be derived
from a presupposition that individuals cannot act responsibly with the
possession of firearms while at the same time assuming that collective
bodies of individuals (such as our federal government) can be or is a
organization that will responsibly conduct legislation and execute
public policy and laws to the betterment of the public good. On the
other side, the conservative argument proceeds from both the
standpoint that the individual can act responsibly with a firearm
and/or (agreeing somewhat with the liberal basis) does not want to be
found without a firearm in the company of irresponsible individuals
who are carrying guns. It is also interesting that the former basis
for the conservative argument assumes that the right to bare arms is
the responsible individuals right to protect themselves against a
hypothetical attack or control of an irresponsible collective body of
individuals (a empire or dictatorship or oppressive government.) To a
certain extent, you have to identify the motive driving your position,
whether it be fear of our government or trust in our government, and
determine the extent to which that motive might be hindering your
ability to critically evaluate the opposing argument fairly in light
of your own. Personally, I don't think banning the purchase and use of
firearms in the United States will do anything to lessen the crime
rates in our country. As has been stated already in this forum, the
gun market will continue regardless of federal policy. Also, we've
nurtured a culture of hopelessness and violence in our country that
(while it may not be root cause of the problem) has certainly not
helped the conditions that drive a person to resort to violent
recourse to deal or cope with certain circumstances where better
opportunities, financial security, or a better education might help
them to make more responsible decisions. I realize that I'm being
horribly idealistic here (as I'm often accused of being) but I feel
that a better public education system, a more dynamic economy, and a
more promising future for the people of our country will do much more
than taking the guns out of all the sock drawers in the U. S. of A.
And, the argument that it works in Britain fails to address the
geographical size difference between North America and the British
Isles, the demographic diversity, the population counts, and the
cultural conflicts that distinguish the two nations. Tighter
restrictions on gun purchases and ownership are definitely necessary.
A ban is not.

A militia of citizens with guns will be our last line of defense in
the case of a government or military coup. Properly trained and
licensed civilian gun owners can protect themselves and their
neighbors in the case of enemy invasion, robberies, and other crimes.
Banning guns in the U.S. would be a huge mistake, plus it would piss
off all the gun owners who use their weapons for hunting and sport.
Additionally, it would create a huge black market for illegal (all)
guns.

	I think you hit the nail on the head with the black market argument

		Now I'm not saying that all the properly licensed and trained

Not to change subject but to show a comparison lets ban large
Vehicle's Truck's Cars Pickups and anything that has a engine larger
than a single cylinder and go's faster than 5 miles per hour because
they kill people more so than guns. but that is a infringement on my
liberty what liberty the pursuit of life,liberty,and the pursuit of
happiness. that don't matter people are to careless to drive such a
large and fast vehicle. and criminals use them to get away and to kill
people with it and kids can get in them and go joy riding and hurt a
lot of people. under age kids don't have a license to drive them and
some adults don't either and still they drive even if it is against
the law and some parents let there kids drive anyway to go to the
store or what ever the law has gotten more strict but it still go's on
and so dose drunk driven and a lot of other thing like
drugs,theft,prostitution,gambling and so on and i don't see stopping
people having Weapons or anything Elise it will just make thing worse
not better responsibility and accountability is the next best thing.
anything that was tried to stop has just got Worse I'm not saying make
it legal for like drugs or anything like that but something ain't
working right. Even when the gun law was in affect the bad guys still
get there Han's on them just a few years ago in California the cops
had a shoot out and the bad guy's had Band full auto weapons and
bullet proof vest the cop's were out Gunned and out matched so if you
want to ban all weapons because of safety then you might as well ban
all things that are not safe. we all take life in our on hands when we
drive a car ride a four wheeler motorcycle flying in plane's water
skying boating rock climbing hiking anything any where any time you
just don't know your no safer with out them thats for sure and i
believe that if I'm responsible enough to fight for our country then i
have the right to have any firearm i want. just as you have the right
to any Vehicle or anything like that as long as your responsible for
your actions and safety of all around you. now if you want to go jump
off a crane with a rubber band tied to your foot thats on you or
skydive motor cross and so on. I try not to tell other people how to
live and i expected the same. but to tell me i don't have the right to
have a weapon that is controlling my life and other's that believe in
the right to have them that are law abiding people. and as i said i
served my country as a lot of others here did and continue to do for
you and every one here in the U.S.A. P.S this is not directed toured
any one Person or Person's here or anywhere on this forum its just my
opinion about banning or gun control if a person wants to harm you and
there is no weapons to steal or bye on the black market he will make
it. and a good Example is a water pipe shot gun or other type's of
ballistic weapon if you don't think so look it up and there's a whole
lot more things that can be made to kill with if they want what you
have. look on you tube for home made weapons and explosive and you
will see how easy it is to do. so just banning weapons won't work if
your a bad guy. Think about it and a lot of the thing are common
things you can get every day at the hardware store and store's off the
shelf. and a lot of the people on you tube that are doing it is kid's
the one's that get hurt the most because lack of guidance from adults
and no supervision. and its Because the ban of explosives and homemade
firearms. to them its illegal and exciting and dangerous.well i said
about all I'm going to say. This is to all that believes in God i hope
he will bless all of you and your's may he bring peace in your hart's
and keep you well. And to those who don't i still wish you well be
good and safe in what ever you do in life.

What's the government made of? People. What's the military made of?
People. What's all of America made of? People. If we can trust our
government and military with automatic weapons, tanks, and explosives
to defend our country, why is it we can't rely on the people of
America to defend themselves? There is only ONE cop for every 2000
people in the U.S. I believe. Congress itself said that it is not
their duty to defend us as individuals, only as a whole, which is
unapplicable when it comes to a robbery, rape, or murder. Every human
has the right to live. However, a "human" with a sick intent of
murdering, raping, and maiming with long list of such words, is hardly
what I would call a human. I call them a monster. Think, do you
believe Hitler had a right to live? What about the 911 terrorists?
What about Seung-Hui Cho, who laughed as he shot his victims at
Virginia Tech? The average response time for cops is a minimum of 5
minutes, with no definite maximum quota. It only takes about 5 seconds
for a crime to happen, and much less for someone to be stabbed or shot
to death. Wouldn't you think if criminals have guns, you should in
fact have one to defend yourself should you ever become a victim? You
anti-gun people bash on gun owners who prey on the defenseless people.
You, as a person against guns, are in fact helpless too, but you do
not have to be. It is not complicated, guns do not take superior skill
to use if they make murder so easy. I'm part of a shooting program,
and in only 3 hours they taught kids as young as 7 how to safely
handle weapons, and never in the 50+ years it's been around has there
been an accident. Someone once told me, "If you give the criminal what
he wants, he won't kill you." Yeah really, as if EVERY criminal was
after your money. Criminals have different intents, anywhere from your
money to your life. Your life is a potential target no matter what the
intent is. Would you rather be mangled, mutilated, and murdered or
have to explain why you shot that thug in the chest? Do not
misinterpret this, but there are criminals that exist who do not wish
to even harm someone. However, what right and reason would they have
to steal from you, scare you, threaten your life, and maybe even kill
you? Another thing someone told me, "Dude you have no chance without a
gun, even with one you only have about a 3% chance." Bullsh*t. Even if
it really was a 3% chance, I think I'd rather have that 3% chance to
live than nothing, even the smallest percent is MORE THAN ENOUGH. If
guns are banned, do any of you think criminals or "law abiding"
citizens will abide by it? Though they may be faulty, some criminals
know how to manufacture their own guns. Despite being faulty, they are
still guns, and they can still kill. Therefore, in a society with
outlawed weapons, a massive black market will arise with criminally
manufactured weapons and weapons that already exist. The same thing is
going on for marijuana, cocaine, and meth, and the method of sale and
purchase is no different for guns. How? Because drugs are illegal, and
if guns are too, then they will just be circulated the exact same way.
Clearly we can't trust our the people and criminals with guns, but we
can trust them to follow the laws? We would ultimately create more
criminals because a majority of the 90 million gun owners like myself
would not abide by it. If guns are banned, it wouldn't prevent
suicide. People will just start hanging themselves or drive off a
cliff. I don't believe everyone should have a gun. Law-abiding
citizens who know how to use it should. By no means should anyone who
is mentally insane, a felon, or simply ignorant be able to use one.
Keep in mind anti-gun people complain about accidents or tragedies
that happen because someone didn't know how to use a gun. You are, in
fact, one of those people who does not know how to use a gun.
Therefore, you are helpless, ignorant, and have no right to tell
people who do know how to use guns what to do.

Gun control is misguided. When guns become illegal for law-abiding
citizens, only criminals will have guns. If they're already criminals,
they aren't following certain laws, and will almost certainly ignore
more if they desire to do so. Restrictions and bans on the
availability of guns to the normal populace only encourages crime,
because it allows criminals to operate with more impunity, knowing
that they cannot be harmed significantly by the victim of their crime.
And no matter how good the police are, they cannot cover all potential
crime scenes. Law-abiding citizens carrying guns can defend themselves
and others in their immediate area more completely than even the best
police force. Prohibiting guns from the good guys just means that the
bad guys are safer. I do, however, believe that a mental health test
should be required to receive a concealed-carry license, just to
ensure that all legal gun owners have the mental faculty to ensure
their own and others' safety.

	"Only criminals have guns" thats untrue because the authorities will
	always also have guns and have better training, tactics as well. If
	criminals choose to guns then they will also deal with the consequence
	eventually. Gun control's main purpose is to reduce OPPORTUNITY. Guns
	make it quicker, easier and less painful to end life. Statistically it
	is proven that the availability of guns increases the chance of
	purposeful and accidental death. There is no reason law-abiding
	citizens need to defend themselves as they are untrained, do not have
	full knowledge of the law and eventually cause more harm than good by
	owning such weapons. The odds are against criminals and even tho gun
	control may never be complete, it significantly reduces the likelihood
	of death by firearm by lessening the chances and increasing the
	difficulty to acquire firearms.

		The problem is that the police system is not efficient enough to put
		those superior tactics into play when they are needed most. There are
		too many cases in which the police never have a chance to respond to a
		threat before a criminal acts, but an armed citizen in the same
		situation could prevent the crime. Gun control does nothing to reduce
		the availability of illegal arms. There is no reason for a criminal to
		recognize and abide by gun control laws if he/she is going to commit a
		violent crime anyway. Gun control doesn't reduce the opportunities for
		violent crime, it reduces the opportunity for a timely response by a
		responsible citizen who could negate the threat responsibly and
		quickly.

Guns dont kill people, people kill people. People sometimes kill
other people innocently a lower percentage of the time but yes it is
there. It is called self defense. If someone breaks into your house
and you shoot and kill that man is that a bad thing? Also if it is not
guns then it will be homemade bombs or just kitchen knives. It would
be almost impossible to ban just like the alchohol ban the US gov
tried. It wont work in the southern states I gurantee it. Most of the
16 year olds and higher that I KNOW own a gun . at least 25% of them.
Which means that they are already toting illegaly so if they are
already how is the gov gonna enforce it if they are already having
KIDS slip under the radar?

well so are bear and lions and tigers. Its not the animal that was
trained to kill people. People train dogs to kill People. Now if this

Banning guns will not make gun-related deaths decline substantially.
The majority of gun buyers are law-abiding people who keep the guns
for self defense. Guns used in street crimes, especially from gangs,
are typically illegal. If guns are banned, the illegal street guns
will still be circulated, but the innocent people will not be able to
obtain a gun for self-defense.

I'm a damn hippie, I suppose, since I support extremely strict gun
regulation. But the keyword there is regulation. Making guns illegal
would just lead to more underground dealings, making it easy for any
common criminal to obtain a gun without being registered as a gun
owner and without having a gun license. While some cases of this still
occur, it would be far more frequent without government regulation.

already are able to get guns illegally and will continue to if they

can get guns illegally.

we would gain nothing from banning guns in america. guns are
dangerous when people illegally use them why would we ban guns in
america? to stop the violence and all the killings linked to them
correct? and if killing people is already illegal what good is it
going to do to make guns illegal. If you are willing to kill some one
you probably don't care what you are killing then with is legal or
not. The only people banning guns in america would hurt are the people
that are defending there homes, business's, families. Since guns are
already a lucrative black market making them illegal would make it
worst. just like banning alcohol did to this nation. look how much
money that made the mob it brought them into power. what do you guys

I believe that a ban on firearms in America will result in widespread
protests and riots, the gun market will continue, people will no
longer feel secure, and an ineffective and possible corrupt system
will be created that will only cause America even more suffering. I
also believe that anyone who says any type of regulation on firearms
is against the 2nd Amendment is quite honestly ignorant of the world
we live in now. Even greater regulation than is currently seen is
needed on the buying and selling of firearms. I mean really let's be
serious here, guns do kill people. But they also protect people.
Regulation is needed to ensure that guns begin to do the latter in
greater degrees.
[Posted by jep93 at 2009-12-06T00:11:35+00:00 - Side: Keep the Guns Change the System]

Absolutely not. In fact, if we force everyone to carry a .40
s&amp;w;than crime rates will drop dramatically. My question is, as a
criminal, will you attempt to kill someone if everyone else in sight
is carrying a large handgun? a .40 S&amp;W;is a large handgun, and
will drop the toughest people in 3 shots. Something else you must keep
in mind is that if we outlaw guns, the only people with guns will be
outlaws, this leaves no defense for law abiding citizens. Now on to
several specific types of guns these idiots wish to outlaw. Shotgun: A
shotgun is not concealable, no one carrying a shotgun is going to get
very far before being detained, or with the "shall carry" law,
possibly shot. A shotgun does way too much damage for you to carry it
into public with positive intents. Anyone who kills a shotgun wielder
can get away with the third degree. Next semi auto: semi-auto is used
by people wishing to reduce recoil, people hunting with poor aim, or
someone who needs self defense. Finally the AK: Someone said you don't
need an AK to take out a deer, first of all, the AK is a semi-auto
weapon if it is legal. Second, the 7.62x39 shell is considered small
for a deer, yes that is right, the AK-47 is a small gun. Third, it is
very reliable. People want AK-47s so they can literally bury them in
sand when things are peaceful, dig them out, and shoot them when
things get bad. Fourth: it is a collectors item. Anyone who supports
the banning of guns doesn't know enough about them to make an informed
opinion, and isn't willing to learn more, and would rather live in
ignorance than try to correct their views. As a side note, all of you
tote your numbers. Whether the U.S.A. has the highest gun death rate
of all countries, I don't know, many of these numbers are incorrect.
Still, if we ban guns, and get every gun off the streets, people will
find something else to kill each other with, I could kill someone with
a rose if I wanted. Either way, if the U.S.A.'s numbers are as high as
you claim it is because you can not kill someone with a gun with a
dagger, so instead of going with the dagger, more people go with the
gun.

Any gun control is unconstitutional. So no, guns should not be banned
nor should any type of ban be in place. 2nd amendment: A well
regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the
RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE to keep and bear arms shall NOT be INFRINGED. any
law to limit type of gun used, owned, or banned guns, ammo, magazine
size, etc. is by definition INFRINGEMENT of the 2nd amendment because
the government is telling its people whats ok and not ok. where in any
of that ideology of gun control laws does that spell freedom? once the
infringement begins with the 2nd amendment where will it stop?
government says movies and video games are to violent and ban them.
big macs, soda, and fries make you to fat so we'll ban those. Gun laws
and bans are put in place that only affect good law abiding free
citizens. Criminals do not follow laws. That is BY DEFINITION a
criminal!!! They will steal guns, get them from the black market, or
from any illegal shipments from other countries if they have to. Most
of these mass shootings happen in so called "gun free zones". where
gun control laws prohibit good law abiding citizens from carrying a
gun to protect themselves and others. These gun free zones like
schools, hospitals, post offices, most government areas, as well as
buisnesses and public conventions that post no gun allowed signs, are
basically advertising to these criminals, psychos, and mass murders
that this will be a easy place to slaughter people because no one can
defend themselves!!! how often do you hear of a mass shooting or gun
related firefight at a place where there are known 100's of gun
carriers like gun shows, police stations, or nra conventions? Because
criminals know some people will be packing a gun there and it will not
be easy. there are thousands of stories where armed citizens stop
criminals, in many cases without firing a shot and just showing the
gun. The liberal media today mostly just films the major gun massacres
and shootings because its big news, gets peoples attention, ratings,
and promotes their agenda for gun control.

I think the whole debate revolves around whether or not you believe
people are capable or incapable of behaving properly in the presence
of a gun. If you are a conservative you believe people are capable.
Progressives (liberals) believe people incapable. To take it further,
if I believe you are capable then it's consistent that I demand
accountability from you when you choose not the behave properly. There
is a basic truth that applies here: Capable is to Accountable as
Incapable is to Unaccountable. Before you respond back, consider which
Ideology seeks to hold others unaccountable and you have identified

they'd find a way.

were banned- this is because the people who were committing the crimes

Should [citizen] guns be banned? - hell no. In an arguement made by
T.S. Eggleston, if guns were banned, a black market would arise as
well as gun smuggling. This in return would lead to an increase in
crime and honestly, who wants more crime? He states that the citizens
with no previous criminal records would surrender their guns to
officials, leaving them helpless and at a higher risk for being
injured. Eggleston further explains that "Criminals will always
continue to break the law and prey on the law-abiding but disarmed
citizens." For the previous arguements that claim "there are almost no
cases where an innocent person has defended themselves with a gun."
Thats bull. According to Eggleston and other statistics, "every 13
seconds, an American uses a legal firearm in defense against a
criminal." So, for self-protection, guns should remain legal. It
prevents overcrowding of prisons, riots, and decreases many injuries.
In return health costs are not forced to sky-rocket. To suit the
people that believe guns should be completely illegal....I do feel
that stricter laws need to be enforced to acquire such equipment.
According to the National Rifle Association (NRAILA), in the state of
Texas, an individual does not need a permit to buy a hangun, and they
are not required to carry registration or a license. This lack of
legislation is one of the main reasons for the decrease in gun safety,
so if we fix this, Americans can be on their way to a happy, gun legal
society. =] http://www.the-eggman.com/writings/ gun_ban.html

A ban on guns would be about as effective as the illegalization of
drugs. Regardless of the law, a determined addict will always get his
fix. A determined criminal will always find a gun. And the law to ban
guns will only serve to disarm the law-abiding, leaving more people at
the mercy of a criminal element. The only TRUE solution to ending gun
violence is to end ALL violence, but that is impossible by nature. A
killer without a gun will use a blade or blunt object, as they do even
today. If you ban guns, violence and death will continue. Ban the
guns, and the knives, and the ropes, and the rocks, and the fists. The
"gun" is just a tool. It can be used to help, as well as harm. It is
the character of the man who holds responsibility for the gun that
determines how it is used. Ask yourself this: Would a gun in your
hands bring only death and destruction? If you were educated about,
and familiar with the weapon, would you be forced to shoot simply
because it was there? Could you envision a scenario in which the gun
you held might save your life? Watch "America's Most Wanted" on
Saturday nights. With every scenario you see, ask yourself if the
victims of those crimes might be alive today if THEY carried a gun. A
simple internet search for instances where a firearm saved lives, and
a few minutes of careful reading are all that you should need.

A ban on guns will do nothing for America except make it hard for
farmers. Most of you have probably heard about Australia banning guns
after the Port Arthur massacre. We didn't ban all guns, just most of
them, because our farmers need them and our police need them. We also
made it near on impossible to get a license to carry them. What I saw
was friends burying their guns in the back yard, wrapped up in oiled
cloths and stowed away in PVC pipe, rather than hand them in. I saw
farmers, now unable to use their semi-automatics, who started to
complain of repetitive-strain injuries because of the sheer number of
times they had to work the bolt action on their rifles when culling
cattle (we were smack-bang in the middle of a drought... it was kill
or let starve). Sure, gun-related violence went down. But violence in
general didn't go down. It simply switched to different forms of
violence. And if this country ever gets invaded, they've now got a
population that can't fight back.

In my opinion, everyone in this country that is over the age of 18
should be allowed to carry a gun. Now before you get offended, let me
state my case. If everyone had a gun then I feel that crime would go
down because criminal would be less inclined to commit a crime against
someone that they know has a gun just like theirs. Now some may argue
that giving guns to people will lead to people getting killed because
of arguments or intoxication. To these people I say, those that would
kill eachother off are really doing our society a favor because if
they are willing to commit murder then really they are uncivilized and
are a threat to the law abiding citizens of this nation. Thats just
how I feel and I'm sorry if I offended anyone that has had a relative
killed due to gun violence. I am sorry for your loss and I don't want
to tarnesh the image of your loved ones but if they had also had a gun
then the asshole (i think this word is appropriate) that killed them
wouldn't have been able to end their lives so easily. Again I am sorry
if anyone feels offended by this.

Most guns used in murders and homicides are obtained illegally. It's
also in our constitution, saying that wear have the right to bear and
keep arms. having open carry laws would actually decrease crime. If
you see somebody with a gun, you aren't going to be stupid enough to
try and rob them are you? it's also a way to defend ourselves, many
crimes are preventable if the victim had a way to defend themselves.
There are also ways to get people to use and keep guns responsibly.

Are You Not Thinking Logically? Guns Purpose Are For Protection. Why
Should We Ban Guns Because They Are Bought And Sold By PEOPLE Who
Should Take More Effort Into Who THEY SELL These Guns To That Are
Inflicted And Abused And Sadly Kill Other People. Why Take Away A
Right To Every American To Keep A Fire Arm for The Sole Purpose Of
Protecting His/Her Loved Ones, Belongings Or Property, Because Of The
Mistakes And Wrong Intentions Of Disgusting, Self-Less And Corrupt
Human Beings. It Is Just Like The Bans On Pit Bulls. You Put Down An
Animal That's Main Intention Inbedded In It's Nature Is To Be Mans
Companion. Yet Let The "Man" Who Raised The Dog From Birth Get A Hefty
Fine And Go Unscathed? Ridiculous, Banning A Product/Thing, Only
Create Doorways For Illegal Markets, And Bring Ideas Into The Heads Of
Thousands (Just Like They Are Finding Ways Now To Abuse The Right To
Own A Fire Arm) Ways To STILL Own And Sell Guns. It Isn't Going To
Make Anything Better, It's Just Going To Make Matters More Dramatic.

people who want to kill, will kill if you ban guns, they will kill
with knives, or something else. when you ban guns murders will still
happen. And criminals will get guns some other way if they have to.
banning guns will leave citizens unprotected from the criminals who
get guns illegally. Allowing non-felon, non-drug addicted, non-
psychiatric persons to carry guns for personal protection should be
perfectly legal.

Clearly gun crime is a problem in some places. And when we look at
gun crime we find it is prevalent in places where citizens have been
restricted from having guns and the crooks have all the (illegal)
guns. Washington DC is an example. Add to that the fact that gun crime
(in an area) is not related to the guns law-abiding citizens have. Its
concentrated in high crime areas where gun laws are weakly enforced –
at best. What we really need is more guns on the street.....legal guns

No because it is our right to be able to defend oneself, and those we

only using them to defend ourselves, as civilians. I personally do not
find a need for one, because I have all the protection I need. Jesus

It is time all the good guys and COPS be trained to handle and carry

are not there for show and tell. They are there to kill and kill. This
why we need cops with guns and other good guys to stop the threat
before our children our killed. They are out there just waiting for
their orders to strike! Did we forget about Russia Beslan School in
2004? 380 deaths and 783 injured! These cops did not have guns and had
to wait for the Russian Military to come (and wait and wait, while
innocent children was murdered!). Just think what one armed trained
cop or good guy could have done! Don’t think for a second it couldn’t
happen to your school or your children. It is time that citizen’s
stand up for their unarmed cops/security and demand they are armed and
trained.

Guns kill people just as much as a pencil miss spells a word. People
kill people. If we didn't have the right to bare arms then there would
be no way to stop the goverment from taking us over. And for all of
you who think the naming of guns will stop killing. Your an idiot,
people will buy and sell guns though the black marget. Who ever said
that guns don't stop a robber or any other criminal, last time a check
three rounds of 9mm will stop a guy dead in his tracks. And for those
who said 90% of rape, killing… guns don't stop there is one reasion.

Like many have said, if guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have
guns. Law abiding citizens would have to break said law to protect
their property and family because the millions of felons out there who
have already purchased guns illegally would not turn theirs in. Even
if they never had bad intentions with them in the first place,
spilling the beans that they even owned one would get them in trouble.
I won't be turning mine in if the day comes. I hunt, which most city
folk no nothing about with their processed foods and/or vegetarian
ways. Most of you on the other end of this debate probably never
touched a gun, much less shot one before, and base your opinion on the
decision that you simply have no use for them. Deer have to be taken
down with an arrow or bullet to be field dressed or taken to a
processor. Cows are different; they're stupid and will just walk right
into the butcher shop. In a perfect world,(not my perfect world) say
every firearm and ammo round was gone, everywhere. Bad people could
still kill you with a knife or heavy blunt object, and inside your
bedroom where you should feel the safest, you could easily be cornered
and stabbed or bludgeoned to death. I think any of you who wouldn't
use a gun to protect yourselves won't use much of anything else to
either. If you had lived in the country, and were raised up by a
father that took you hunting, you wouldn't feel the way you do. I live
in an area where people get murdered about as often as a lunar eclipse
occurs, but I always keep a pistol close by. It's better to have it
and not need it, than to need it and not have it! Children brought up
around guns have considerably more respect for them. When you hear of
kids finding a gun and one shoots the other by mistake, I think of a
yankee that never showed it to them, or taught them safe handling and
I imagine he never shot it himself. If you are satisfied with the
thought of curling up in a ball when an intruder crashes through your
front door, by all means do. But, they are going to kill you if they
want to. If somebody breaks through my door, I'm going to shoot them,
and then ask them why they didn't knock. You can have my guns when you
pry them from my cold dead fingers. People are just generally better
once you leave the city. Sure, there are still people living off of
the system, but mostly people around here have to work to survive. It
seems much easier for a criminal living in the city to kill and steal
there, and walk around the corner to make a buck off the treasures
obtained. God blessed texas! We have more guns than any other state,
and by far the nicest people who would go out of their way to help a
stranger in need. I've been broken down out of state more than once on
a busy road, and helped change tires in Florida and ll the way back
across to here, and in every case it was hours before someone came
along that gave a shit. Here you'll have 3 pickups pulled in behind
you in 10 minutes time, and that's on the road less traveled. If you
don't respect our second amendment, you are a yankee, Democrat, and a
douche. And you probably use your horn more than 10 times a day. And
you're probably a bit of a dick. You probably don't say a kind word to
strangers either.

If guns or firearms were to be banned think of the unemployment rate
that would increase greatly. Firearm companies would go out of
business because there would be no customers. The ammunition
manufactures would go out of business also because of the lack of
users. The economy is already unstable as it is. This is one of the
many reasons why guns should NOT be banned!

If we did ban them it could turn into what the Prohibition was: a
time where alcohol (and now perhaps guns) is sold on the black market
and sought after arguably even more. If we ban guns it'll give more
power to organized crime and also take away an economic chunk from the
USA (from selling guns, hunting etc.). It should also be noted that by
banning guns it could cause social upset and people protesting their
right to wield arms, thus causing civil unrest and cracks within
society.

So Guns take and save lives and for those people who are talking bout
kids getting hurt cuase they think its a toy the parents of those kids
should put the guns in SAFE'S or somwhere where the children cant get
to its called being responsible i mean sure some people are stupid and
go buy a gun they know nothing about and either hurt themselves or
somone their with. Now the second reason to keep guns if you have a
robber that comes into your house and you think oh just let them have
it and you hide somwhere and they know your there they will find u and
either kill u or rape u now see if u had a gun in a safe under or by
ur bed and a robber breaks in thats when u role out of bed open the
safe grab ur gun hide somwhere and when he tries to get shoot him in
the stomach or chest who cares if he dies or not he was the one who
took his chance on it by robbing you. And you should feel the need to
get protection especially if you have children what if a rapist/serial
killer breaks in do u wanna see ur kid get raped and killed that could
have been prevented had you had a gun to protect yourself and ur
family cus u better know that if i have a wife and kids or its just me
i will grab my gun and shoot the idoit that tried to rob me. or lord
help me if i have to stick up for somone who doesnt beleive in guns i
would help him even if he could help himself Just because some people
are stupid doesnt mean they have to ruin it for the rest of us it
called hunter safty for a reason and it does save lives and oh ya im
16 and i have the brains to know that guns save lives

brought us Al Capone, imagine what the banning of guns would give us.

I love how individuals that don't know a thing about guns are trying
to impose their views to infringe on others 2A "Rights". No one is
questioning the 1A "Right"?!!? To let everyone know there is no state
in the country were gun ownership is illegal....That would be
unconstitutional! However there are many states in the country that
infringe on the right of certain types of gun ownership. Lets take New
Jersey, It is illegal to use hollow point bullets(which are legal just
about everywhere else) because so one got a hold of bad information. A
hollow point has less chance of doing secondary damage than a FMJ
round. I am using this as an example people who know nothing about
firearms so not speak until they get the facts. I have never seen a
gun jump of the self load itself and walk down the street and start
shooting people. If some one has I would like to know??? The actions
of a few should not dictate the actions for everyone. People complain
about laws not working because the LAWLESS ARE BREAKING THEM. I value
human life and the police are not required to protect the individual.
(I cant remember the federal case but the SCOTUS said that the police
do not have the obligation of protecting the citizen) So who does?
Most people don't realize that semi-Auto assault rifles are regulated
by the state. However fully automatic assault rifles are regulated by
the Federal Government. Every time the new puts something about
assault rifle they show FULL AUTO federally regulated rifle which can
only be transfered and not but new. (the federal firearms act of
1985). So get the facts before you start disputing because you will
find that the info you have is wrongfully skewed! An armed society is
a safer society.

1. A gun is an inanimate object and once a bullet is removed, it is
as useless as a paper weight and will never function again till
someone makes it. 2. Getting rid of guns prevents death, but hammers,
screw drivers and cars killed people, as did clubs and bows and spears
before guns were ever invented. 3. Obviously being unarmed and
defenseless or running from a criminal is better than using a gun to
stop them, especially for the old, the crippled, pregnant women, etc.
4. All we need are safe rooms, martial arts training and a phone to
call the police, which means the losers who live in mobile homes dont
need protection, we could beat carreer criminals with our bare hands,
and a police car miles away is better than a gun which is inches away
when your life is in danger. 5. People who support getting rid of guns
and say they dont feel threatened is because they have never been
threatened. 6. I am in a public building and I have a gun in my
vehicle. The four girls around me are alive not because my gun is out
there and it would scare them for me to bring it in in my hand but
because I also have not decided to take the framing hammer in my back
seat that they would ignore and use it to beat one or more of them to
death with it.

I'll preface this by saying that I have never in my life felt unsafe
or afraid in my day to day comings and goings any where I have lived.
I don't carry a concealed handgun because of a fearful existence or
paranoia. I also do not have a "commando complex" which would make me
one of the worst kind of wannabes seeing I have never served in the
military or law enforcement. I actually do not have any desire to use
the gun on anyone and pray I never have to pull it for any reason. I
don't place myself in dangerous situations or go places where I think
danger may be present. In other words, my primary form of self defense
is avoidance of potential danger, not confrontation. That does not
make me a coward, because I have inadvertently and unintentionally
found myself in situations where I have had to step in to defend other
people (without a firearm), and I have responded pro-actively and
decisively. So setting aside those common accusations against people
who carry concealed handguns, why do I carry one? 1. Because I can. It
is a right afforded to me by the U.S. Constitution and the Arkansas
State constitution. It is afforded to me by a concealed carry law that
law abiding citizens should never have had to fight for. Nonetheless,
it has been hard won through long and expensive legislative action to
develop what we have today. It is a right and the more of us who
obtain the license and carry the guns, the harder it will be for
controlling politicians to reverse it in the future. 2. Because it is
my duty and responsibility to take advantage of a right afforded to me
by what I believe was the guiding hand of an almighty God in the
framing of the Constitution of the U.S. and the Bill of Rights. 3.
Because I choose to take responsibilityy for my and my family's
safety. Police generally arrive at a crime scene after the criminals
are long gone and the devastation to citizen victims is already done.
It is foolish indeed to believe that that our civil governments have
the ability to protect us from the sub human predators of our society.
4. Because I live in a real world in which I recognize the dangers
above are present. To do otherwise is to stick our heads in the sand
and ignore an ever-present danger among us. 5. Because I want to be
part of what makes criminals wonder if the next person they choose to
assault may be the one that ends their life. The more law abiding
citizens that are armed, the less sure criminals can be of the outcome
of their actions against us.

ok anti-gunners, imagine this situation, a mass murderer is looking
for a college to attack. He sees two different colleges. A sign on the
first college says gun free zone, and a sign on the second college
says armed staff and students. What college do you think he's going to
pick.

	Mass murderers should be detected and treated. And should NOT have

	Stupid argument. You're using an extreme example to demonstrate the
	legitimacy of gun ownership? I can chop and screw your argument down
	to make it more complex, as you should have done from the very
	beginning anyway. 1) A mass murder will have some form of mental
	psychosis, or history of violence. This means that in a state/country
	where it is required by law to have a full medical and criminal
	background check cleared in order to obtain a license to yield a
	weapon, this mass murderer wouldn't have a chance at obtaining a gun
	in the first place. Ban guns altogether? They'd have to turn to the
	black market. And this isn't an easy process, either. 2) Let's say
	where this man lives, guns are banned. If he wants to go on a killing
	spree he would have to be extremely dedicated to the cause. Whether or
	not he obtains a gun, this guy is clearly dangerous and will kill with
	any means necessary. 3) There are more incidences of school shoot outs
	in America compared to any other developed country in the world. What
	is the difference between America and the UK, Australia or Canada?
	Well let's see here... oh yeah. Guns. 4) "Guns don't kill people,
	people do". Hm? Of course - a gun is an inanimate object. However,
	missing the big picture here. More guns = higher homicide rates. Less
	guns = lower homicide rates. Are Americans just more violent by nature
	or are you too hung up on your 2nd amendment rights to acknowledge
	there is a problem with guns?

I dont think guns should be banded but i do think we need to get rid
of the black market sales of guns i live here in Oklahoma where you
can go to the state fair grounds where they have a gun and knife show
and they dont even check back grounds or nothing that is a bad loop
hole in the system and you can buy a ar15 ak47 and so on but if you go
in a regular gun shop here you can not buy that type of weapon i think
those type of rifles should stay in the military not on the streets
but i also think if people want to carry or have one in there homes
they should have to go to a mandatory gun course and it not be very
simple like it is here where i live and get there licence to beable to
buy and own one and some type of mental evaluation this can be all
done and probably costly but it will make some kinda of a difference
because we all need to protect our self's and i believe that will help
keep most of the insane nuts from just going out there and being able
to buy one i love my freedom and being able to own my guns and being
able to pack one to protect my self but i think the laws are just to
loose just for anybody to go in a store and buy one i know you have to
go thru a backgroung check but to me thats not good enough because not
every body has a felony record but they still dont have any business
owning one and not even capable of shooting one but they just walk out
the door with no training and most of them with no clue on how to
shoot one so theres my thought and opinion im sure most wont agree

i am surprised that nobody has said anything about the jobs that
would be lost if they ban semi auto firearms. one of the only branches
of business that is flourishing right now. lets put more people out of
work shall we. back to the task at hand. most vehicles we drive in
u.s. have the capability to go over 100 mph. these vehicles are used
every day on roads that will never Legally allow you to drive over 80.
yet everybody still buys these 100 mph + vehicles. car accidents and
vehicle related deaths by far out weigh the firearm related deaths.
why arent they banned and have all of the cars thrown in a big pit and
burned while we all walk to work how would that be. of course nobody
needs the cars to go over 100 mph. but guess what we have them. why.
because WE CAN. do we really need semi auto weapons. maybe, maybe not.
but there is more cause to ban 100+ mph cars than firearms. and by the
way all of you idiot peace blah blah blah hippies out there. i am an
American and i love my cars that can go over 100 mph i love my
cheeseburgers and i enjoy shooting my semi auto firearms. not for the
soul purpose of killing people, but for my own personal enjoyment.
America was built with the understanding that a corrupt government
would never allow their "subjects" to have firearms. why do you think
they fled and came here in the first place. that is why it is
important to keep this right in the constitution and not a chopped and
diced version that corrupt politicians have molded to suit there
needs. but a pure constitution that means what it states. that i have
the right to keep and bear arms. even semi auto rifles and handguns.

I know this is an old debate but in light of today's events in
Connecticut I have been doing a little poking around on the internet
and came across this... Here's my thought - Criminals and anyone who
wants to get their hands on a gun, any gun, can and will. They don't
care that guns are outlawed - in fact, that spurs some people on to
have one just because the government says they can't. What, do we
think that a criminal is going to sigh, throw up their hands and say
"Gee, I guess I can't own a gun - gotta find something more productive
and socially acceptable to do... " No, in fact - if we ban guns I
believe the criminals are going to rejoice because it gives them an
upper hand when committing their crimes. Look at drugs - they are
outlawed and banned but our children today are STILL dying from
overdoses because drugs are still on the street. It didn't deter
criminals from owning, using or distributing it. It will be the same
with guns. Tighter control - perhaps - but until you can GUARANTEE
that no one, ever again, will be able to have a gun in their hands
when coming into contact with me, I say we can't ban guns!

Attempting to use the logic that guns should be outlawed solely based

Typically it is the maniacs who own the guns who kill people.
Sometimes, other methods of killing are used and have larger effects.
For example, millions of jews were killed during the Holocaust,
sometimes with guns, but more times than not they were killed by
poison. Sometimes, bombs or blades are used more than guns. If no one
has a gun, criminals will find some way of getting guns and killing

i don't believe that the problem is weapons. the problem in this
nation is the poor up bringing of children, we have lost the values
that built this great country, we have lost respect for human life and
forgot that we are brothers and sisters in humanity and the channels
of communication have been shadowed by violence and newer generations
that only believe in the importance of self image and respect in the
streets. when i was an 8 year old girl my dad took me hunting for the
first time, when i shot the rifle he gave me, i instantly fell in love
with the sport. but it wasn't just the sport he taught me about, he
also showed me the huge responsibility that lies behind that trigger
but most of all he taught me that something so small like a bullet
could change your life and someone Else's in the blink of an eye, and
if you ever harm someone with it... it must come down to fearing for
your life. what we need in this country is education. we spend more
money in prisons then colleges and then wonder why parents are not
educating children with values now a days. it isn't guns that kill
people, is the mentality these people carry around in their heads that
kill other people. there is a bigger picture then what we are seeing
here, and a bigger monster to tackle. if someone wants to kill, they
will kill, gun or no gun. banning guns is not the solution. education
is.

No, because it is a second amendment right to allow citizens to keep
firearms. To control the sale of them is one thing, to ban them
entirely is unconstitutional and a over reaction. Look at all the car
accidents that result from reckless drivers. Should we ban the cars to
prevent such accidents. No. Such a overreaction is like burning down a

Thing is, full on gun bans don't work. Not if you already have really
lax gun laws to begin with. Not even restrictions would work in our
society. You see, millions, if not, probably trillions of firearms and
related items have been diffused across the United states over the
past sixty years. Like all material items, a lot of these guns, and I
mean A LOT, have been traded, sold, bought again, or locked away in
storage and forgotten. A lot of them at gun shows, where one can
purchase a new or used firearm without having to register it. Even if
the government were to go down the list, name by name, of everyone
who's registered a firearm, at least 95% of those names would be
outdated, as the owner had sold it a long time ago. My next point is
that we would be defenseless. Look at Australia, for instance. One
small shooting and -BOOM!- No more guns. Of course, guns are not fully
banned, but are really hard to acquire. That being said, when the
government asked for all the guns back, the good, law-abiding people
coughed them up, while the criminals kept them. This resulted in an
increased crime rate. The baddies had nothing to fear, because the
odds that their targets had a weapon was slim to none. Lastly, even if
you banned guns, and everyone -even the criminals- handed them in like
good little minions, the criminals could very easily just acquire them
illegally; That, or come after you with a hatchet or machete.
Honestly, if I had a choice, I'd rather be popped once in the head
with a .45 than be hacked to death, piece by piece, while I'm still

What sucks is both sides have some valid points but one side is going
about it all wrong. Limiting guns or their capacities to hold
ammunition will not stop the violence it will only change the tools
used but probably not even that as we see in examples. Whats worse
than guns in this country is our technicalities. All a technicality
should do is save someone from being put to death. There should be no
instances where we consider someones background for a crime committed
and its sentence. But then again there are so many things considered a
crime in this country any more just to generate capital that
everything needs to be considered before a change like that can
happen. We've complicated things so much because we allow feelings get
in the way of the real agenda. Protection is a basic right from anyone
and from anything, murder is not and until that is addressed, all
these what-if scenarios to create an agenda are wrong. Yes they occur
and must be addressed but it should not be mixed into another agenda.
The gun owners using any verbal ammunition no pun intended to protect
their rights as you have seen are only retaliating to all these what-
if scenarios you create to infringe on their rights, which is also
your right if you choose to accept it. These men and women have not
done anything wrong for you to attack them and are only defending
themselves from an attack. The second amendment was put into law by
the law for they knew the travesties that could happen when law
corrupts. We as individuals know how the country 'should' work but we
do not see all the gears turning and changing and many times these
gedon'tdont get oiled or over oiled and we must keep our basic rights
unscathed or we will then be scathed. I understand we are complex
beings but if we keep over complicating certain things the real
problems will never get addressed. So to all you homos who write all

won because of it. Eat this. Mines bigger than most of yours and Im

Guns don't kill people. There should be perhaps more restrictions or
background checks (for people with mental disorders, etc.) but the
only people that would be affected by banning guns would be the lawful
citizens. If you make it illegal to rob a bank, the criminals would
continue robbing banks even if it was illegal. Criminals would still
use guns. They don't care what the law is. Responsible gun owners
(like myself) use them for lawful reasons. Mainly I have guns for
hunting, riflery, etc. Not even with an emphasis on personal

With bigger, more important issues than gun control looming around, I
think gun control can wait. Plus, it isn't exactly a nat'l security
threat, considering the current population, roughly 314 million
strong, and birth rates in the US, 30k lives to gun related homicide a
year is a small price to pay. You'd think, with the gun control side
composed of lawyers with remarkable skill, they'd know better than to
badger people with emotional pleas like their favorite argument, think
of the children. These incidents are famous because they happen so
rarely. My niece and nephew go out in public all the time and the come
home in one piece 99.99% of the time. All I have to say to the parents
of the Newtown victims is I'm sorry this happened to you, it is simply
tragic, but dwelling on it won't make the pain go away, surely you

I don't understand why people think that by guns being banned in
America would reduce crime? Of course it won't stop crime because
criminals are not going to go buy a gun legally anyway, but rather
from the back of the van. Large majority of gun owners do not like the
idea of the background check, which in my opinion does is a very good.
I had a background check when I purchased my gun and no problems at
all. I have absolutely no problem with that. Of course, it won't stop
criminals completely, but at least it will reduce the number of those
who should not own guns. In addition, criminals will think twice about
harming someone when you live in a state where the gun laws are not so
strict........and no, I am not a NRA member nor do I ever wish to be
one.

Guns dont kill people! I am against assualt gun bans! Not only are
these toy fun and look good, they are a simble of American freedom.
However gun education and gun safty are important. For example, teach
a child not to play with guns and that they can and will kill people.
Assualt guns are already tough to come by, this would only effect law
abiding citizens! It would also mean people who illeagaly buy guns can
so easily kill us without guns. So if you ban guns even more poeple
might die to them. With a gun in your hand for defence you can kill
the person tring to kill you. Beter them then you right?

No guns don't kill people , people kill people And saying gun kill

toast,toast,toast Once after this debate went major I set out a gun
with it loaded setting it in a lawn chair right beside me in my front
yard and numerous people went by like the mailman guys on motorcycles
and little girls playing and despite all the chances the gun had to
shot someone about one thousand times that day and it never happened
but then I went hunting found a nice deer and then I yes I shot the
deer and it died by who me Have you ever noticed that guns never get
credit for killing but the person does ? That's because the person
kills the person shots not the gun unless there like the toy story
characters and walk around when I'm not looking which I highly doubt

Guns most certainly should be banned in America. As a Canadian, I
know this argument better than any American alive today. Whilst true
that guns do not kill people, they provide those with the ability to
kill. Look at all of those school murders. The theatre murders. Need I
go on? Had those who committed the murders been denied access to such
weapons, those children would still be alive today. To allow others
the ability to own guns puts our children in danger.

NO!!! This great nation’s founding fathers adopted the 2nd Amendment
in 1791, which protects the right of individuals to keep and bear arms
in America: “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security
of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall
not be infringed.” I believe that once ultra liberal politicians and
voters begin (actually they have already begun) to chip away and erode
our inalienable constitutional rights, American as we currently know
it, will quickly begin to implode within and eventually crumble. Just
read history…its happened repeatedly since the dawn of civilization.
If the 2nd amendment were to go away, then guess what, so then will
the 1st amendment, 3rd amendment, 4 amendment, and so on. Starting to
see a pattern here America? Guns are just inanimate objects, no
different than a car, a knife, a hammer or a baseball bat (all of
which can just as easily kill people BTW). Hmmm, so lets outlaw cars,
knives, hammers and baseball bats too. Yea right. Do you see how
utterly ridiculous and useless gun control is! So you see…guns don’t
kill people…people kill people. Lets focus on fixing the root of
America's core problems: the mental health crisis, stop letting
prisoners out of prison, stronger parental control over their children
playing violent video games and TV, fixing our broken judicial system,
and the list goes on and on. Besides…even if all guns were confiscated
by the government, tens of thousands of illegal guns will still be
easily attainable via the black market and the cartels.

The purpose of guns isn't to kill people. It's what people do with
them, but it's not their purpose. Just like a kitchen knife isn't
meant to cut things. It's meant to prepare food, as a gun is meant for
protection. Also, mass shootings are a pretty recent phenomena and are
relatively rare in the scope of gun violence. Guns save way more
people than they endanger, it's just that mass shootings make for
juicier stories than self-protection in a home invasion. Banning guns
is essentially taking away our INALIENABLE right to protect ourselves.
Criminals don't follow the law, so what makes you think a criminal
wouldn't own a gun illegally in a ban. The only thing that happens is
an imbalance of power has been made. Certain people, namely criminals
and police, are now more powerful than the people in need of
protection. As for "heavier" guns, I think that ownership of them
comes with freedom. Anyone has the choice to own a fast car, but those
kill more people than guns do, so why not ban them? Because it's
ridiculous.

I don't think guns should be banned because they are such a strong
part of american culture. Back in colonial times, everyone had a gun.
America was still mostly a frontier at the time. It was partially
because of this that the revolutionists were able to fight back
against the army of the world's superpower, they all had weapons and
knew how to use them. That gun culture remains in america today. The
right to bear arms is also one of the constitutional amendments, so
that almost ensures that guns will remain legal. On the other hand, I
do think that restrictions should be tightened. As it is now,
background checks and restrictions are way too loose. Every few weeks
there is a new school shooting, and I have heard of so many gun deaths
and accidents from people close to me. Yes, guns should stay legal,
just more restricted. And for those of you who say "I can use it to
protect myself from criminals", tell me. How many times has that EVER
happened? I bet you can find a few examples somewhere on the internet.
But the ratio of Gun Accidents to Guns Used in Self-Defense is very
high.

Just because a gun can be dangerous, doesn't mean no-one can have
one. Countries with no guns have lower rates of gun crime - but that
doesn't mean you can forcibly take a gun off of someone who owns one.
What would end up happening would be that law-abiding people would
hand in their guns, but there would still be people (including a lot
of dangerous people, as well as people that just want a gun) who just
don't hand in their guns. In the American Constitution, it states
that: "the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be
infringed." Changing the amendments can't (or rather shouldn't) be
done. The amendments are there to ensure the freedom of the people -
guns are allowed so people can protect their freedom from the
government. If you were to just ignore the second amendment and ban
guns completely, it would end up being a lot easier or seem more
possible to change other amendments (for example freedom of speech).
By all means, gun control laws could be increased, but it isn't a good
idea to just ban guns completely.

	i gree with cole because i like my privacy to be kept private
	[Posted by Chaz549 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	agreed. i perfer to have my internet to my own privacy...........
	[Posted by nbartzen at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	ya but what if you were looking up something you shouldnt
	[Posted by jmusiedlak19 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

		i agree with jenna because there are those people who use it for
		wrong things
		[Posted by cschalk at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

Without the government regulating the internet hackers could send
half or morer dof the U.S into pandemonium including disrupting the
bussiness sector.
[Posted by rnygaard at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	Ryan has a great point because hackers are a big threat to our
	nation.
	[Posted by Chaz549 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

		but not all of the hackers are on the internet alot use other methods
		like scanners and scams over the phone
		[Posted by gabem22 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

		the government should worry more about hackers. but i dont think that
		thye have to regulate and look at everyone on someones internet
		searchs and everything.
		[Posted by nbartzen at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

		i agree with both of you guys because hackers could easily hack to
		someone facebook or others.
		[Posted by jmusiedlak19 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	yes they should not allow hackers and should be able to see them
	[Posted by cwodach at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

The government should not "Control" the internet but should be
allowed to scan for virusis and hackers. I'm sure they can find a way
to do this without demolishing our peace of mind and eliminating our
privacy rights.
[Posted by LauraS at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

I don't think the government should be able to control the internet,
but it should be able to control what's on the internet. Instead, the
government should enforce stricter privacy policies on websites with
more important persoanl information, like banks, insurance, private
government, and websites that want your social security number, to
make it harder to get into.
[Posted by AbbyNich at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	I agree with you because the internet should be control little bit
	more but we should have some privacy too
	[Posted by mekultgen at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	I agree with you, but some of the people who are doing bad things
	should get their privacy privllages taken away.
	[Posted by taylorann at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	yes, whats on the internet should be a little controlled but not a
	private network. It wouldn't be fair to not have privacy when you've
	been behaving on networks
	[Posted by SarahMay at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	i agree with abbs because it would give the government alot of extra
	power that should be equally given to the states.
	[Posted by Chaz549 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	I am in total agreement with you. If the government found a way to do
	this, i think it would stop most hacking if not all.
	[Posted by Gwen_Lade at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

Looking through what we as citizens look up, the government is taking
away some of our rights and it should not be allowed
[Posted by gabem22 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	The only time that they should be able to is if you have a criminal
	record or something like that
	[Posted by gabem22 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

I agree with Abby completley! The government should control the
things that are uploaded on to the computer.
[Posted by MaryAddy12 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	But that can't always be a good thing... If there are limits on
	everything on the internet, That can effect sites like social media!
	[Posted by kykronberg at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

Yes, Morgan I agree with you as well. You would think there would be
a way to track the people that are doing bad things on the internet.
[Posted by MaryAddy12 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

The government should regulate the internet to prevent hackers but
other then that should leave it alone.
[Posted by Cuaroc at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

My final satement is that the government should find a way to control
whats being uploaded to the internet that doesn't take away are
freedom and rights.
[Posted by MaryAddy12 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	I agree, they should regulate what is posted on the Internet.
	[Posted by cwodach at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	I agree that the government would be taking away our rights. If
	government starts putting on restrictions and regulating the Internet,
	it would probably be for their own reasons and interests, not the
	peoples'. The people would have no say in what happens.
	[Posted by Gwen_Lade at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

i agree with everyone that thinks that we should relugate the
internet to an extent
[Posted by KayleeS at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

I'm kind of double sided on the topic. There are goods and bads on
each side. We can either have complete freedom or be safe...
[Posted by kykronberg at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

Are the Chinese not going to find out too much information about
American secrets if we do not regulate what they see? It is a matter
of national security as well as a risk to you private information.
[Posted by mrarmyphs at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	I agree with that comment a lot. I think that the government should
	regulate what the foreign countries see because most Americans aren't
	trying to cyber attack their own country. Also the government should
	have firewalls after firewall so then people cant get through.
	[Posted by DSchweiger at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

No. I think that they could regulate what’s ON the internet, to get
rid of porn and other inappropriate and illegal stuff, but I think
that the majority of citizens aren’t doing bad stuff on the internet
so our privacy shouldn’t be invaded. Monitoring an innocent person’s
online activity will not protect the country from hackers. This would
take away from our freedom of speech and let the government take
control of another aspect of our lives.
[Posted by eharpstead at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	I agree, Ella. There is never a need for any innapropriate images,
	text, or media of any kind.
	[Posted by Lauryn101797 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	But how do they find out those sites unless they regulate the people
	who go on those sites? to find those sites, they need to follow where
	those poeple go. I think that they should monitior a person's internet
	usage, so they can find those sites
	[Posted by mitchell-17h at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

		Maybe they should regulate certain "trigger words" that could be a
		big red flag. They should only monitor your internet usage if you are
		or become suspicious or a threat to the government.
		[Posted by AbbyNich at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

			I agree with taht, but not everything innapropriate has a site with a
			triggger word. The site could be an exact opposite. So that would be a
			good idea though
			[Posted by mitchell-17h at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

				Sure, but a lot of the things people would look up to find some of
				the things we don't want them seeing, they'd have to have something at
				least slightly related to what they're trying to find. You're not
				going to look up "Rocks" and find military blueprints.
				[Posted by AbbyNich at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

			But if i wrote something like "bomb" or "Terrorist" or some king of
			word that would be a trigger word in like a facebook status... I don't
			wanna be called out by the government... And there are facebook
			accounts that do that kind of stuff for a joke also fake twitters..
			Like Helen Keller!!
			[Posted by kykronberg at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

				Yeah, "bomb" or "terrorist" might be caught in a filter, but I'm
				pretty sure the government has enough common sense, although it might
				not seem like it, to figure out if a post is fake or not.
				[Posted by AbbyNich at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

					There are a lot of "Trigger words" being typed EVERY DAY.
					[Posted by kykronberg at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

						I understand this, but the more serious trigger words should be taken
						very seriously. If they're on Facebook, the government won't take it
						as seriously.
						[Posted by AbbyNich at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	When it comes to our country's secrets, though, there should be more
	limits. But for our day to day facebook posts which are not killing
	the country, the monitoring shouldn't be there. Plus this would cost a
	lot, wouldn't it? We can't really do that.
	[Posted by eharpstead at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

		But facebook is just another source. Just because its a social site
		doesnt mean there are not innapropriate things on it. If monitoring
		facebook can end the innapropriate things on there, I think they
		should monitor facebook to. And by the way, facebok is already being
		monitored, when interviewing for a job, COmpanys are able to monitor
		your facebook page, to see if you'v done anything wrong. This is
		already hapening, so why not let it go through.
		[Posted by mitchell-17h at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

			I think that what we need to know is whether or not we will be
			watched or not allowed to do stuff. It's hard to explain, but I am all
			for watching for hackers. I am also ok with people seeing what we
			post... that's why stuff is public. But to have control over us is not
			right.
			[Posted by eharpstead at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	I agree with ella because if they can control everything that we do
	or see on the internet, that would be invading our personal privacy.
	[Posted by lizzyfrancis at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	i agree that they should regulate what is on the internet that way if
	someone is looking up something that could be of harm, or is just
	innaprotiat, should be blocked or taken off the internet
	[Posted by nbartzen at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

the goverdnment should regulate the dinternet to keep user's privacy
from hackers.
[Posted by rnygaard at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	I have one question for you. Do you even care if the government goes
	into your facebook or other social places on the internet and looks at
	your private info.
	[Posted by mekultgen at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

No, because the privacy of how much you want to personally protect on
the internet is up to you.
[Posted by Lauryn101797 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

The privacy of what you do on the internet is a privilege and should
stay that way, in my opinion.
[Posted by Lauryn101797 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	I agree because if you are behaving on the internet you shouldn't be
	monitored. If you are not doing legal things then you should be
	monitored.
	[Posted by moklumpyan at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

		I agree with you, Morgan. People shouldn't have to worry about the
		government watching over what they are doing on the internet if they
		are just doing what they should be doing on the internet. You
		shouldn't have to be monitored if you're respecting privacy laws and
		looking at appropriate media.
		[Posted by Lauryn101797 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

			But not everyone IS doing what they should be doing on the internet.
			People wouldn't have to worry if theyre doing the right thing!
			Regulating the internet should definately be done
			[Posted by mitchell-17h at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

			I agree with you Lauryn, we shouldn't be watched if we are doing
			nothing wrong. Only the hackers, or criminal people should be watched.
			[Posted by taylorann at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	I don't think we should be monitored either because most people
	behave on the internet. It would only be nice to monitor the people
	that don't behave and hack others, only because people deserve their
	own privacy. Everybody has rights and privacy should be one.
	[Posted by SarahMay at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

No. I feel the government would be infringing on your privacy. They
would have control over the internet and would be watching everything
you do. And they would end up limiting free speech.
[Posted by Gwen_Lade at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	I agree on the issue of invading our privacy. There has already been
	cases of people hacking in to webcams and watching people. That is not
	acceptable.
	[Posted by moklumpyan at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

I think that we need more security on the internet. without security
there is not privacy.
[Posted by nbartzen at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	privacy is what everybody wants and with security would actually help
	a lot with that because it would be harder to hack.
	[Posted by SarahMay at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

I see why they would want to do this but i do not agree with this. I
believe people should have as much privacy at there house. I agree if
they have cameras to monitor people at like libraries or anything like
that but i don't agree with it being in our homes
[Posted by cohenning at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	I think they should be able to monitor public networks but private
	networks should not be under the governments control.
	[Posted by moklumpyan at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

		I agree that public networks could be monitored and private networks
		unmonitored because its obviously called "private"
		[Posted by SarahMay at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	I agree, we shouldn't have to worry about somebody watching what
	we're doing while we're at home.
	[Posted by JJisacoolguy at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	Private networks shouldn't be subject to regulating. We have serious
	issues if private networks are no longer private.
	[Posted by AllyB495 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

I say it depends on how they are gonna control the internet like are
they gonna restart the whole internet by deleting everything on the
internect. Also I dont want the government looking into my personal
stuff on facebook because everyone needs some privacy.
[Posted by mekultgen at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

I think that the government should be able to regulate what websites
are on the internet. If the content is harmful or illegal then they
should take it off. But if they regulate what we post in social sites
then it is invading our privacy and taking away our freedom of speech.
[Posted by moklumpyan at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

Example: Fifteen privacy groups have filed a complaint with the
Federal Trade Commission seeking an investigation over deceptive trade
practice. call for government action when its at it's strongest if
Facebook breaks its promises. If Facebook violates its own privacy
policy or its promises to users, government should and could
investigate and take action to prevent further problems.
[Posted by Lauryn101797 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

I agree with Ella, but we also need security to keep away hackers .
[Posted by rnygaard at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	I'm totally for keeping away hackers. But looking at what we're all
	posting would be very time-consuming and would not result in much
	protection. But I do think hackers need to be stopped.
	[Posted by eharpstead at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

		I agree, i think that they need to keep away hackers but find a way
		to not get into everyones business
		[Posted by lizzyfrancis at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

			That's a great comment because hackers are very dangerous to people
			because they can steal peoples identities and they can also damage
			things. But if they look at people they might be looking at the wrong
			thing.
			[Posted by DSchweiger at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

i think that the goverment should relugate the internet so people can
have their info private and so peoples acounts dont get broken into.
[Posted by KayleeS at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

I think that the government should have access to other peoples'
privacy, IF they think that the person they are looking at is a threat
to the United States, and needs to be checked out.
[Posted by Prem123 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

I belive that government should regulate internet usage, because it
will stop hackeers. The regulating will stop the hacking before it
starts, not only saveing money, but also savng innocent people and
cathcing the wrongdoing of others.
[Posted by mitchell-17h at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	Mitchell why would u want someone to monitor your every single little
	thing you do on your internet i know you agree with it cause Ur all
	like omg omg we got some terrorist trying to find a recipe for a bomb
	no its not like thAT AND IF THERE ARE DIRECTIONS TO MAKE A BOMB ON THE
	INTERNET THEN THE GOVERNMENT WOULD BLOCK THAT SITE OR DELETE THE SITE
	[Posted by cohenning at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

		Yes agreed with cole, who wants to have people watching every single
		thing you do on the internet all the time. How about some privacy!
		[Posted by gabem22 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	If it were just monitoring it would be fine. But regulating makes it
	seem a little harsher. If this is just about watching for hackers,
	that'd be fine.
	[Posted by eharpstead at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	Sure, the regulation would stop hackers and maybe save money, but it
	would also be VERY costly. Imagine how long it would take to regulate
	everything on every website. The interent is HUGE. Take into account
	all the people that would take and they also need a salary, therefore
	making it more costly than money-saving.
	[Posted by AbbyNich at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	Mitch, how will monitoring the internet stop hackers? they will just
	find a way to avoid the monitoring anyway
	[Posted by gabem22 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

		Then we need to upgrade our technology to stop this!!!!! I fwe have
		no technological defense we are dead
		[Posted by mitchell-17h at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

No, they shouldn't control are internet because It's our privacy.
People do terrible stuff on the internet that is inappropraite but
thats their choice, I think it's wrong but what about freedom?
[Posted by MaryAddy12 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	Haha wern't you just agreeing with abby that you were for the
	goveernment taking over the internet?
	[Posted by kykronberg at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

I don't think the government should usse caameras to monitor you, but
monitor you by what sites you look up.
[Posted by rnygaard at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

I think that the government should give users of the internet more
privacy. Everybody deserves their privacy, I dont think that people
should be able to look into people personal things.
[Posted by JJisacoolguy at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

I don't think the government should be able to regulate the internet.
It infringes the peoples rights.
[Posted by Jake25 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	I agree with jake its our right and our freedom to do whatever we
	want to do on the internet
	[Posted by cohenning at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

I do not think that the government should regulate the internet. It
is the user's decision on what they put online. They should be well
aware of what they are saying and the aftermath. User's should know
that the information they post can be read by anyone and used against
them.
[Posted by AllyB495 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	But then again, the government can be very paranoid. The nation's
	safety is one of the priorities and we don't want government secrets
	to get out. A war sparked by technology would truly start the tech
	era. America's plans need to stay within our shores, not on the
	worldwide web. The wed provides unlimited options to people. Both good
	and bad.
	[Posted by AllyB495 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

the internet should be regulated, but to an extent. to stop hackers,
but not to totally not have any privacy from the government
[Posted by nbartzen at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

I agree with cole i wouldnt want some one to look atmy profile or
something if i didnt know them
[Posted by KayleeS at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

Monitoring our every move on the internet is an invasion of one of
our basic rights. There SHOUlD be SOME privacy, but not to an extent
where our every little move needs to be watched.
[Posted by Lauryn101797 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	Yeah, a loose monitoring system would be fine. Not every search. We
	do require some privacy.
	[Posted by AllyB495 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

I tihnk that the person should have control over their own privacy
and that they can choose if they want privacy or not. If they want
privacy, then they can do it by taking precautions, if they think that
they dont need privacy, then that is their choice.
[Posted by Prem123 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	I agree. The government has so much control over us already, and
	controlling our every move on the internet would be a little too over
	the top. Taking precautions doesn't have to mean watching every little
	thing we browse on the internet.
	[Posted by Lauryn101797 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

Why must these debates fill up the argument waterfall.
[Posted by Cuaroc at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	Ah yes forgot DV happy class.
	[Posted by Cuaroc at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

		PLEASE LEAVE YOU ARE BEING VERY "DISRUPTIVE" TO PUT IT "NICELY"
		[Posted by mitchell-17h at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

		How low can you get??? Sitting on CreateDebates and arguing with
		students? Who has time for that? Get a job, "Cuaroc". Please leave us
		alone.
		[Posted by eharpstead at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

i dont think that we should relgate it but yet i do to an extent
[Posted by KayleeS at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

If you are behaving yourself on the internet, browsing appropriate
sites, and keeping personal information on the "down-low", the
government watching over your moves shouldn't be an issue. It is
however, an invasion of privacy and in my personal opinion...kept to a
limit to not overpower our freedom.
[Posted by Lauryn101797 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	But there are multi Billion dollar industries that revolve around
	"naughty" web-sites. so if that is deleted so are thousands of peoples
	jobs.
	[Posted by Chaz549 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

		Just because they get caught, oesnt mean that the people lose thier
		jobs, just the poeple who are working with that site
		[Posted by mitchell-17h at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

The government may be taking some rights away, but it might be a good
cause, and rights are basaed on what we as a people agree on.
[Posted by rnygaard at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	The government keeps taking little rights away and after a while, all
	of these little rights taken away add up and seem like we can't do
	anything on our own anymore without being monitored
	[Posted by gabem22 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

I think that the government should be involved with the internet
because if they were'nt, then it would just be easier for people to do
illegal things. But i also don't think they should see everything that
people do because thats invading our privacy. If they don't want
people to do as many bad things, then they should take some sites off
the internet or make them illegal.
[Posted by lizzyfrancis at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

the government should regulate the internet at the extent of seeing
what people do at their homes, not many people want old men looking at
you through your web cam. I think they should track certain words so
they can figure out what people are up to. they should also delete
blue-prints to military weapons so the enemy countries dont copie us.
[Posted by Chaz549 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

I agree with Laura. The internet should not be regulated by the
government, but can be scanned
[Posted by Jake25 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	I think it should only be scanned up to a certain point or time of
	browsing history.
	[Posted by Lauryn101797 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

The government is taking away our freedom of speech by tracking and
regulating what individuals post on their accounts. Privacy should be
given until you have messed up by using illegal websites then their
actions should be monitored.
[Posted by moklumpyan at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	I agree with you, our freedom of speech and the press is restricted.
	But, also they wouldn't be able to find out if you did use an illegal
	websited if they didn't at least have a loose regulation.
	[Posted by AbbyNich at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

I dont think that the government should look at what people are doing
unless someone is doing something bad.
[Posted by taylorann at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	i think they should the whole time because people can always look op
	very bad things that they shouldnt
	[Posted by jmusiedlak19 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

		I totally disagree, the government shoud not be able to just look
		into people's provate lives/information. People deserve privacy.
		[Posted by JJisacoolguy at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	i agree because there are bad things on th internet and should not be
	shown to others especially younger citizens
	[Posted by cschalk at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

The government has so much power over us already, I personaly feel
that having them monitor every little thing we browse would be taking
it over the line a little too far. We need to have our privacy and
freedom too, just like every human being should have.
[Posted by Lauryn101797 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

Chaz makes a good point about the military related things, but not
the rest of what he said.
[Posted by Jake25 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

I believe the government should look only into internet sites that
have suspicious activity and that how they should control the
internet.
[Posted by mekultgen at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	i agree that they should look at the sights that are very bad and
	popular
	[Posted by jmusiedlak19 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

With the advancements in technology, the government should have a
quick easy way that users could report hacking and illegal content.
That way the government would find out about it and wouldn't have to
monitor all users.
[Posted by moklumpyan at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

I disagree with Ryan. The government has no right to interfere with
our rights.
[Posted by Jake25 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

It would be invading our privacy, privacy is part of our rights.
[Posted by taylorann at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

Megan makes a good point. The government should only scan for
suspicious or illegal activity.
[Posted by Jake25 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

Mitchell is right the govrnment needs to monitor who goes on what
sites so they find those sites.
[Posted by rnygaard at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

The government should control their way of how people make purcahses
online. If they buy something online, then i agree with the fact that
you need credit card information and addresses for shipment, but once
the website gives the buyer verification, then the personal info like
cards and addresses can no longer be viewed.
[Posted by Prem123 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	You have a good point about websites getting rid of personal
	information once it's no longer useful. What if someone wanted to
	purchase from a website more than once? Who wants to go through re-
	entering all their information?
	[Posted by AbbyNich at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

I think that the goverment shouldnt have to look or relagate the
internet unless someone is doing something bad on it.
[Posted by KayleeS at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

the government should lightly overlook what people put on and look up
on the Internet because there can be disturbing things put on the
Internet and should not be shown for all the public, but they should
not be over protective for it
[Posted by cschalk at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	I think it is the parent's responsibility to protect what their kids
	are able to see. They should put a type of 'safe search' on their
	computer if they are concerned. The government would also be
	infringing on others' rights if they took the inappropriate things
	off. That stuff is still legal to be put on the internet.
	[Posted by Gwen_Lade at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

Pros: Prevent things like Identity theft You would know where you
personal information is going when you buy things on the internet. The
government would ensure that online businesses handle user’s personal

and don’t need any help from the government. Computer software’s can
scramble credit card numbers to help from being stolen or misused. I
personally agree with the idea of putting regulations on the internet.
I can see the other side of the argument, but in the end it just
protects you more. I believe that if we regulate the internet it would
help to prevent credit/debit card number theft.

Yes I think that the Government should regulate the internet to

something or shopping online, the Internet sites are not required to
tell researchers and shoppers how their personal information will be
used. Not just that but even though the website may say no one else
but us will see this information, they could easily be lieing. Along
with that, you could be telling your private information to an

the government to be watching what users are doing on the internet.

government already does a lot for us, and they don’t need to protect
individual internet security. That would be a lot to take care of! The
government shouldn't need to regulate because the business regulates
on their own. The business wants their users or customers to come

We should make smart decisions. That’s why we use extra long
passwords! We can deal with it ourselves. It’s like when your mom
looks at you text messages, you tell your friend what guy you like,
You don’t want your mom to know! So if you don’t want your mom to know
why would you want some random stranger from the government to know
your personal information! That’s crazy! I think that children
predators are bad and that’s why we shouldn’t be stupid and give out
personal info. So I do understand personal information is important to
keep safe. I just think we should have the responsibility of doing it
ourselves.

No the government should not regulate the internet to protect user's
privacy because we pay money from our own pockets so we can do what we
want on the internet and go on what ever site we want to go on. We
have rights and if the government protects the internet it will
deactivate our rights because we are not allowed to do what we want
even though we have to pay money for a computer and pay money for
electricity to go on the internet and all that money came from us not
the government so we should be able to regulate the internet for our
self and not the government.

	But if they don't regulate it at all, hackers could easily get into
	our bank accounts and steal our money, also people could get into
	important government information.

		Still I get what your saying but, what What about your personal
		information do you really want some stranger from the government to
		view it? Protecting information is easy to do considering we can use
		spyware, antivirus and Firewalls. Maybe what the government should be
		focusing on is creating even more advanced spyware.

No. 1. Security is offered on the sites, they scramble credit card
numbers for protection 2. Software is updated often as well. There
could be countless other ways that your identity could be stolen. It
is not just bad websites. 3. When people are putting their important
information on the computer they should realize that they are taking a
risk, and it’s not someone else’s fault, but only their own. 4.When
they are putting important information they should completely trust
the site before they give away credit card or phone numbers.

The government should regulate the internet so that people cant hack
into someone's account and take their information. Also the government
needs to regulate the internet so that when people sign up for a
website they know how their information is going to be used and if it
is going to be shared.
[Posted by OliviaH at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

No! Most of our computers do it for us like scramble the numbers on
your credit card for you. The government shouldn't be able to see what
we are doing every second of every day. It's not like the CIA would be
looking for a terrorist on a Wal-Mart site looking for shoes. It's not
the governments business what we do on the internet. It also shouldn't
matter what Kmart or some other site does with our private information
like credit cards because nothing to bad has happened from that yet.

	If they did monitor us it could be regulated so that they can only
	see certain things, and not every single thing you do.
	[Posted by Ian180 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	And if they did regulate us it wouldn't be watching us, it would be
	them protecting our credit cards and national security numbers.

I also don't want some creep sitting in a dark room to look at my
pictures on facebook.
[Posted by eohman21 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	If the government regulates the things we are doing, they can also
	see you emails, facebook, twitter...So it's not any better than a
	creeper.
	[Posted by majerusem at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

No because if the government can see what we are doing 24/7 then they
can look at our personal emails and all of our passwords and so on.

Regulation of the internet by the government might be useful, but it
almost seems like a waste of resources when there are much more
important, pressing matters. Protecting the people online should be a
priority, just not the first priority. It would be more beneficial if
there was an easier way to weed out the websites and companies
stealing information so they can be shut down without the government
getting involved in everything.
[Posted by ElisabethB at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

yes, because if they do we will be more protected while we are o he
internet.
[Posted by Grauman at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

I also don't think that the government should be involved with out
cyber problems because what if they start to go into all of our things
then take from us. We cant do anything about it because who would we
tell? They would have an advantage over us because we wouldn't know
how to react to it all. If they can protect us and leave it be like
that I would be totally with the bill. But if they end up using it
agents us what would we do.

I just don't agree with the government regulating businesses that do
it. I think that is dumb because the businesses will regulate
themselves so their customers will come back.
[Posted by eohman21 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

If the government would take away rights to companies then you
couldn't buy things online.
[Posted by joserile at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

The government also shouldn't regulate our internet security because
if you agree to something like giving your personal information to a
website, you should know that anything can happen with that
information. It can be passed around and that would be your own fault
if something happens because you put it on.
[Posted by majerusem at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	Yes, very well put. I agree.Which makes another point, what will
	happen to sites online that you can give out information. This reminds
	me of an adult dating website. Would they be blocked then?
	[Posted by Maddypatty4 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

People should be aware that there are scary people on the internet,
but that doesn't stop them. They shouldn't regulate the internet
because people should be aware.
[Posted by bfreddy at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

No because if the government can see what we are doing 24/7 then they

I think the government should regulate privacy on the internet
because hackers can to many things that can ruin the lives of others.
Not only do hackers bring down businesses and look at personal
information they can become a part of your life by using the things
you say and do against you.
[Posted by bingersoll at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

No, the government should not regulate the internet to protect users'
privacy because by protecting our privacy they can invade it.
[Posted by jalevsen at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

People should be aware when they are giving out personal information.
I they are afraid then they should not to it.
[Posted by bfreddy at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

Couldn't the government look over once a year to look for business or
companies that try to take peoples money.
[Posted by joserile at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

I don't think the government should be allowed to regulate
individuals internet but I think that it should regulate big companies
or people know for felonies
[Posted by CheyenneB at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

If you were to get your credit card taken by a business could you
shut it down by something?
[Posted by joserile at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

I could go either way I mean if the website companies use the users
private information to get at there personal things then there should
be some sort of regulation to let the people know what they are
getting into, but if the companies don't use the information then
there is no point in the regulations because they won't do anything to
help the people. All it will do is cause the companies to lose money.
[Posted by jdoherty at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

I don't want my accounts getting hacked, especially when it comes to
things like banking accounts and important things like that. I
wouldn't want someone getting into my information and stealing my
credit card number or something like that.
[Posted by Drewkrablean at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

I think the government should stay out of the lives of the citizens
completely. Run the country, not our personal conduct! I'm an adult
and I don't want Uncle Sam telling me how much I can use the Net, nor
what sites/services I can use, etc. Everything the government seeks to
regulate turns out badly, ie the Wars on Drugs and Terrorism, etc. Do
we really want these same people regulate our use of the Net?
[Posted by wolf291 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

In this case, I think the Government should get involved to protect
the privacy of all individuals.

Enjoy the pros and cons of government regulation. Please try to back
up each statement with evidence you found and that you make an
inference on.
[Posted by mrarmyphs at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

I think the government should not put a privacy user because then no
one would use the internet and that would make the companies go under
[Posted by pefeldmann at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	would protect?

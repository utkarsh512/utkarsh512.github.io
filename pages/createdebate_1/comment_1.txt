Now this shows the Totalitarian mindset of the Left : Should people
ignore these orders, police have been given the power to disperse
gatherings and issue fines.

	Now this shows the Totalitarian mindset of the Left : Should people
	ignore these orders, police have been given the power to disperse
	gatherings and issue fines. Most American states are also ordering
	people to stay home you dumb hillbilly.

					Brit you cannot follow your news outlet ? Britain is currently being
					led by a Conservative government you laughably stupid hillbilly. If
					you want to make debates accusing Conservatives of being
					authoritarians then that's your own stupid fault. You won't get any
					arguments from me, moron.

Yeah your right. Leave everyone out, cause 1000's to require
hospitalization and die. Why don't we just euthanize everyone with a
cough?

The Brits (and others) acted faster and passed a better economic
stimulus that focuses on keeping people employed instead of putting
everyone on unemployment: https://www.newyorker.com/news/ our-

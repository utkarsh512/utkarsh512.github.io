Hello excon, Here's the math: 1. The TOTAL amount we spend on
healthcare 2. MINUS the health insurance industry's part 3. Leaves
enough left over to buy a couple aircraft carriers. Rip Zap excon

	Only problem is libs want to put 20 million illegals on this dole,
	which screws your math and allows anyone else who can get here to come
	for free service, which screws the math even more.

		Libs struggle to get what they want because they always move from
		sane position to 20 steps too far. Hey Cons, we want gay marriage!
		They get it. Then they intentionally target people to try and get a
		bogus discrimination lawsuit going. Hey Cons, we want to bring
		illegals here. Then they intentionally don't go after them for crimes.
		That's how you quit getting what you want. Conservatives don't trust
		them to do things rationally in any area, so they just don't even
		listen to their screams anymore. We hear but don't listen.
		Compromising with the left winds up with the left weoponizing anything
		you give them against you and demanding more with violence and
		outrage. Sane people deal with this by not dealing with it. The
		fingers go right to the ears.

	imagine that your steak represents the TOTAL amount we spend on
	healthcare. But the DUMB BASTARD has yet to produce any NUMBERS? Is

that wacky tobacky and have lost touch with reality.

	I think you've been puffing on a peyote-packed peace pipe, or some of
	that wacky tobacky and have lost touch with reality. Hello High:
	Yeah.. Everybody says it WON'T work, but nobody says why.. I used
	addition, after all.. Let's just look at this little corner of health
	care.. Be prepared, I'm gonna use math again.. You guys always say
	that NOBODY dies in the streets.. All ANYBODY has to do is go to the
	ER, and they'll GET treated.. If I were to take you at your word,
	apparently EVERYBODY is covered for EVERYTHING, today as we speak..
	Whatever you wanna call it, that's UNIVERSAL health care.. It's just
	not the most cost effective way to deliver it. Consequently, if the
	people visiting the ER had doctors to go to, they WOULDN'T visit the
	ER, and we'd save BILLIONS and BILLIONS on ER visits ALONE.. I used
	math again.. Hope that doesn't bother you.. excon

		Hello excon, Here's the math- ? 1. The TOTAL amount we spend on
		healthcare - NUMBERS? 2. MINUS the health insurance industry's part -
		NUMBERS? 3. Leaves enough left over to buy a couple aircraft carriers.

			NUMBERS? Hello again, poochy boy: Thanks for asking. Let's say you've
			got a steak, and you wanna eat the WHOLE thing.. Now imagine that your
			steak represents the TOTAL amount we spend on healthcare. But, you
			have to give your wife a piece of steak in order to shut her up.
			Imagine, again, that she's the health insurance industry. Now, here
			comes the math.. If you DIDN'T give her a piece of steak, your steak
			would be BIGGER. In the same vein, if we DIDN'T give the health
			insurance industry a piece of our health care dollar, it would be
			BIGGER. I'm simply saying that we could use that BIG piece of money to
			pay for actual health care.. Most people can UNDERSTAND that math
			WITHOUT needing numbers.. I hope that worked for you. Rip Zap. Now,
			fetch this stick.. excon

				Most people can UNDERSTAND that math Except that once it's "free",
				everyone without insurance, which is 44 million people, will flood the
				hospitals along with those who want seen more and for God knows what.
				Not to mention the 20 million illegals libs want to cover as well
				which will quickly become 30, 40,50, 60 million once everyone down
				south sees free care up north. We'll go bankrupt. Not if but when.

		Hello: It's really a simple plan, if you remember.. We just RID
		ourselves of the private health insurance industry.. Here's how it
		works on the ground.. You're sick. You visit a doctor. He bills
		Medicare. Medicare pays the bill. Rip Zap, done. Certainly, if
		EVERYBODY is covered for EVERYTHING, nobody NEEDS insurance. Once we
		apply their share to actual health care, we'll have enough money left
		over to buy an aircraft carrier or two excon Here again this what the
		FUCKIN DUMMY said which shows how IGNORANT it TRULY is! I used

		What you aren't telling them is that in order to support covering
		everyone fully, they will have to tax you at 90% of your income, and
		that we all end up with long lines, rationing, and less quality
		doctors due to less pay. Ypu also leave out that those numbers compile
		quickly once people can go to the doctor 10 times for "free" rather
		than the once they go now. You also leave out that in countries with
		this system, where they can't fit the bill through heavy taxes, they
		charge what's left of your income to cover costs, winding up with
		lesser quality care and people not going due to having to pay if taxes
		can't cover it. It's a cycle of failure.

"INSIDE EVERY PROGRESSIVE IS A TOTALITARIAN SCREAMING TO GET OUT"
[Posted by outlaw60 at 2019-01-29T21:44:10+00:00 - Side: You don't know squat, excon]

	Nah, I think the progressives are more about an irrational fear of
	hierarchy. They feel "oppressed" because they are weak and incompetent
	pussies looking for someone to blame other than themselves.
	Totalitarianism is a good thing when done correctly, as the
	enlightened should rule over the feeble.

					It's simple Outlaw. Liberals are just weak people who are
					disconnected from reality. They deny the differences between race,
					gender, culture and countless other things and want to live in a mono-
					chromatic communist world where everyone and everything is blended
					into one perfectly equal splotch of grey postmodernist vomit.

I think we should be taxed in order to provide support for the
government. Our money supports things such as caring for the elderly,
providing public education, protecting the environment, and other
basic necessities like safe food and water. Taxes help the government
work effectively on solving social issues, and creating justice and
economic security, so I think they are beneficial.

	I agree because without taxation the government wouldn’t be able to
	pay for the necessities within a community like roads, mail,
	firefighters, police, schools, etc. As long as there is appropriate
	representation behind our tax dollars, it is necessary. Though I
	support less taxes, there is a need for them.

When we pay taxes, we are ensuring a safer environment in which we
live. Our tax money goes to our society to better it, such as paving
roads, building government facilities, and paying salaries of police
officers and firefighters.

In my opinion, taxes are very necessary. The rate of taxes could be
debated, but I think their existence is a "must." Metro times
describes all the things taxes are used to build and support. The
source says, "Taxes pay people to build pipes to carry our poop away
and pay people to carry our garbage away." Taxes also pay for roads,
schools, police, etc. Taxes certainly seem like a burden, but without
them, I think we would finally recognize their significance. Article

Although taxes seem pointless and most Americans believe we shouldn’t
have them, they actually are necessary. Without taxes, we wouldn’t
have roads to drive on, and taxes pay for major health programs such
as Medicare and Medicaid, social security, and defense/security. The
social security system provides retirement and disability benefits.
Taxes also pay for unemployment insurance, food stamps, low-income
housing assistance, and programs for abused and neglected children.
Taxes help people more than they hurt them, and I believe they should
stay. https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/ general/how-are-federal-

We should be taxed because that’s how we can pay our military,
police, firefighters, etc. these are the people saving our lives on a
daily basis. If they don’t get paid then there’s nobody to save us if
something happens. Supporting evidence:

We need to pay taxes so we can receive funding for public schools.
Studies show that additional school funding improves academic
performance and increases the income earned by students as adults.
Paying taxes now will allow us to have a more successful future.

Taxes are a good idea because they help put roads on the map,
skyscrapers in the cities, and keep a stable increase in economic
growth in society. if taxed were taken away who would clean up the
roads of all the potholes, who would clean up the city’s the towns
after major storms, who would make the houses that families of the
future need. we do get a portion of the money back anyway when you
file for taxes, so you are getting money back.

Even though taxes, in the moment of getting your check, can seem like
a bad thing, they are really not. Taxes provide citizens with such a
better society to live in. Taxes benefit every citizen, rich or poor.
Taxes pay for things like our roads, education systems, military, and
our local first responders. Without them, we would not get to live in
the growing, prosperous city that we have today.

Taxes suck. No one likes to have their money taken from them. But as
much as they suck, taxes are necessary. Without taxes, the government
wouldn't be able to fund all the cool infrastructure that we have. We
wouldn't have police, roads, public schools and all that nice stuff.
However, sometimes our taxes goes towards things that aren't so
useful. But that's just a consequence of having infrastructure. A lot
of people say that everyone should have the option to pay taxes, that
taxes shouldn't be inforced. But I'd say that if paying taxes were up
to individual choice, no one would pay it.

	This same argument is made over and over again about schools and
	helping the community but how many people on this side actually looked
	up the national budget and examined the amount of money that went into
	each of these. A very minuscule amount of the budget goes towards
	these things. We’re entrusting the government with our money and then
	not paying attention to where it is actually going.

		It may be a minuscule amount for schools, but if we don't pay taxes
		our government can't function. Keeping our money means our government

Yes we should! our taxes pay for schools, food, businesses, and even
military. If we didn’t pay taxes we wouldn’t have any of our everyday
needs like education or safety. Taxes help us live and survive. We
drive on roads and eat foods everyday, we wouldn’t have these things
without taxes. Shelters for the homeless are also payed for by taxes,
if these weren’t here, a lot of people would be on the streets and
stealing.

I think we should be taxed. Taxes are used to better the country.
Without taxes there would be no way to pay for military, firefighters,

enough for travel. Taxes also help support government programs such as
homeless shelters.

I think we should be taxed because our government needs the money to
develop and maintain a good infrastructure. The money is also needed
to take on our many social issues and is necessary to help local and
national emergencies. all of the money we pay in taxes goes to
different places and is used to support a good society.

I believe we should pay taxes to the government. It gets us thing
like parks, libraries, and military funding. I do not agree with the
high amount of taxes and think they should be brought down in how much
they tax us, but should not get rid of them. I think taxation should
be income based and the higher the income the higher the tax should be
and vice versa.

I think we should be taxed, because it helps pay for important things
that most use everyday, like roads. Without taxing, our education
wouldn't be as advanced, because there wouldn't be a source of income
for the schooling. Use paying taxes pays for our officers and
firefighters, and without them every town would struggle. These are
just a few reasons it is important for use to be taxe.
[Posted by Abbyfitz at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

We should be taxed, in order for the local, state, and federal,
governments to have the funds they need in order to provide services
to the American public. But this tax should be a progressive tax, one
that changes based on income level, rather than a flat tax, which is a
set figure to come from your income, regardless of how much you have.
So that middle- to lower- class individuals can pay a portion, and
still be able to afford basic amenities, and the upper-class can pay
more, so that society as a whole can have better access to basic needs
and services, like education and infrastructure.

Think of paying taxes as tithing at a church. When you tithe, you
give money to grow the church and to spread outreach. Taxes are
basically the same thing. In order to fight terrorism, provide public
education, care for the elderly, etc. we need to pay taxes to the
government. Nearly everything we have today; roads, schools,
businesses, have been paid for by the public’s taxdollars. So instead
of seeing taxes as a bad thing look at them as paying your dues to
enjoy such a great society.

Taxing citizens is how the government gets its income. Without taxes,

Yes we should be taxed because our tax dollars are the reason why
police officers and fire fighters get paid. They dont get paid as much
as they should, but every bit of pay they recieve is from tax dollars.
Our tax dollars go towards the roads that we drive on to the parks and
libraries that we go to. All of these things are funded by tax
dollars. Even teachers get paid with some of our tax dollars which is
why they have crappy pay for what they do. Being taxed gives money to
my family to provide support for yours. So yes, we should be taxed.

	While you are correct that we need schools, parks, and other public

	attention towards their school systems, justice systems, and public
	areas are also the same areas that contribute little to no tax dollars
	towards their own cities. In inner cities such as these, the
	percentage of welfare recipients who are not legal US citizens is

The money you earn means nothing if you don't have a road to drive
on, a functioning hospitality, law and order from police, military
protection, and on and on. There will always be SOME taxes. The only
way to not have them is if you're in a totalitarian state and the
state already owns every last thing including your butt. The question
with taxes is where to balance them out. You may balance them
differently than I would, but that's where the politics of it all come
into play. It's folly, however, to simply boil it all down to you
should keep all your money. That conclusion is basically just an
admission you really don't understand society or government so you're
going to take the most extreme banner of critics and wrap yourself in
it.

the military, the government those are good reasons, I don’t think we
should be able to keep it even though I would love the extra money. I
don’t know what to spend it on when I have it, nobody does it goes to
their head just like power people who have more power it tends to go
to their head and they get big headed and end up losing it all anyways
so what’s the point of having extra money if your just going to spend
it all anyway.

I believe that taxes help a lot especially at the beginning of the
year here is an article to help with what I believe in. “The money you
pay in taxes goes to many places. In addition to paying the salaries
of government workers, your tax dollars also help to support common
resources, such as police and firefighters. Tax money helps to ensure
the roads you travel on are safe and well-maintained. Taxes fund
public libraries and parks.” -Gaige Reece

As my article states one of the main arguments against taxes is the
fundamental basis that it stands on. Whenever taxes were created
people did not mind contributing money to help fund schools or public
programs, however taxes have been molded into something else where the
government expects a certain portion of our money to do whatever they
want within the budget. Many investors do more with their money by
contributing it to privately owned charities then they do by paying
taxes. The amount of money dedicated to public works and schooling now
is significantly smaller than many of the other items on the budget
list. This shows that all of the tax money we think is going to
providing clean water and better roads is actually going to fund some
other aspect of the budget instead.

	than the government , th government is set up with the tax system so
	that we did have to worry about spending our money and not have to pay
	for things out of pocket. So you are going to pay to build schools,
	pave roads, fund shelters etc. all these things are types of examples
	of things our tax dollars pay for. And truthfully the amount you give
	up in taxes is not as much as it would be for you to pay for common
	luxuries we are given daily. While I do agree the government is not
	always the best and doesn’t always make the best decisions with tax
	money I do still believe that all in all the tax system is a good
	thing and something that is necessary for our survival and for the
	common good of the way we live.

I believe that in a free country the money belongs to the person who

shouldn't have it taken away from them, I do agree that a certain
portion of money should be set aside for things such as national
defense and the justice system but the government shouldn't have their
hand in my pocket for something such as welfare programs. People who
are unwilling to work should not receive my tax dollars, I have no
remorse for a weak individual who expects a handout. Individuals who
physically cannot support themselves(i.e. Disabled people) are a
completely other topic. If we want smaller government, reduce the
amount of taxes that Congress has to play with. Small government was
the reason why the economy was booming in the 1920s, big government
was the reason why the Great Depression hit.

Society as a whole has been enslaving itself through hierarchical
methods since the dawn of time. It’s a food chain, but every level has
the potential to overthrow its successor. In modern times, this is
demonstrated through Social Security, identities, and taxes. Democracy
alludes to freedom and taxes leave a foul taint upon America’s sacred
principle. If an individual has the power to control oneself and
his/her actions, they should be in control of ALL parts of their
livelihood. Higher powers use the people’s money as a mass to fund
wars based on political agendas, to further organizations that could
be corrupt, and to do what seems like the opposite of what taxes are
actually implemented for. ~ Gavin

I personally think that people assume the worst case scenario, and
think that without the government, in its infinite wisdom, everything
would crumble. There are many roads already paid for by private
organizations (i.e. Gated communities being paid for by Homeowners
Associations, and roads near shopping centers being paid for by the
center.) Private schools are already in existence, and homeschooling
is another option. The whole system of mandatory public schooling is
arbitrary. Children should be taught useful skills rather than mind-
numbing and creativity crushing information. The military could be
paid for privately (the McArmy).

In a free country, money belongs to the people who earn it. The most
fundamental reason to cut taxes is an understanding that wealth
doesn’t just happen, it has to be produced. And those who produce it
have a right to keep it. We may agree to give up a portion of the
wealth we create in order to pay for such public goods as national
defense and a system of justice. But we don’t give the government an
unlimited claim on our money to use as it sees fit.

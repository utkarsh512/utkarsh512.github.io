Fortunately, the repubs are not empowered to prevent it. Should
Reagan have received book deal ? He got $2 million just for a speech
in Japan so.....?

YES, YES, YES! Last I knew, if you do da crime, you do da time, you
get another chance … in that order. I wouldn't object to Trump doing a
book after HE gets out. (Or, should I say, having a book done FOR him.
I think his records … as locked up as HE should be, …. would show him
not capable of writing his own. (He has a LOT of trouble with words …
like outlaw. ;-) I've said before, I think he paid for his "degree",
and some lucky "good student(s)" came out of college with a degree
that cost HIM/HER nothing. Today Trump's would be a bit more
expensive. HELP, BERNIE!! :-)

	I wouldn't object to Trump doing a book after HE gets out. (Or,
	should I say, having a book done FOR him. I think his records … as
	locked up as HE should be I definitely agree with you that Trump
	should be behind bars, but unfortunately the problem is much deeper
	than this one man. You also have millions of people who voted for him
	and indeed, several members of this very site who are prepared to
	excuse anything and everything he ever does wrong. To me that implies
	there is a very serious problem with the emotional mentality of people
	living in America.

		There were 3,000,000 MORE that voted against him. I agree we have a
		mental problem in the U.S. (I try not to say "America" because
		Canadians, Mexicans, Brazilians, etc. are ALL "Americans". It would be
		nice if more realized that). Point is, the majority of U.S. are still
		sane, as the last election proved. I hope in the next one we embellish
		on that, and maybe get a better health care that will include "mental
		health" … for those STILL in Trumps wagon! (And the NRA's)!

				Only found out today the biggest cause of bankruptcy in the U S is
				......medical debt that’s truly appalling Yeah, that really gets on my
				nerves. America just doesn't want to adopt any of the common socialist
				balances to the excesses of capitalism. Free healthcare and higher
				education would irrefutably make America a much better place.

					I don’t generally trust any politicians and I don’t label a policy as
					in health care socialist just because it’s good , I live in a
					capitalist country but have never paid a penny into a healthcare
					system yet I’m covered if I need medical attention and hospitalization
					this I feel should be a right in all countries whether they brand
					themselves Socialist or Capitalist as it’s the humane thing to do.
					Myself and my wife are also entitled to a state pension tax free of €
					500 euro between us on reaching retirement along with our private
					pensions , every citizen gets this along with reduced power bills free
					tv license on retirement . A citizen if unemployed is entitled to
					welfare for life if need be and housing I pay 1 per cent tax as I’ve
					artist exemption given to anyone who is deemed an artist . The system
					is far from perfect but it’s fairly good , we see these things as a
					norm because of the taxes we pay we feel entitled and to me that’s a
					progressive system

							It’s pretty ok you won’t be out partying on it but it’s the extra

							etc , if you live on any of the many offshore islands and you speak
							native Irish there’s an extra allowance for keeping the language alive
							along with a hardship allowance as it’s pretty wild in winter I lived
							there for a year and loved it

									I guarantee you would love it I meet Americans every week over here
									and nearly everyone tells me how much they love it a lot say they
									would love to retire here The countyside is astonishing and even in
									the capital there’s still plenty of it, the people are cool we take
									the piss out of each other unmercifully and we like a little drink or
									two mostly . I lived in the U S back in the day Santa Monica and loved
									it I like Americans but the religious ones terrify me they’re on a
									different level

			There were 3,000,000 MORE that voted against him. Yes, but don't fall
			into the trap of assuming all those people must therefore be sane.

				There are levels of sanity. If they voted against Trump they are on a
				higher level of sanity than those who voted for him, obviously.
				Another point, over 60% of the NRA has been in favor of "reasonable
				gun control". Another is that not ALL gun owners are insane, or even
				crackpots. (I'm one of them ;-). I would bet that at least 1M of that
				3M ARE gun owners, or, I should say that millions of the "63"M are gun
				owners and still have their sanity. Most of the nuts flock together
				under one flag and it has a big "T" on it (and likely a red star!)

			Point is, the majority of U.S. are still sane I can't agree with you
			on that brother. For one reason. Guns.

				I can't agree with you on that brother. For one reason. Guns. So
				let's make video games and possibly rape causing penises illegal
				genius. Oh, and cars. And food. And water. And being a leftist. Being
				leftist caused some deaths. Let's ban it.

				I never said they were. Only a few years ago many more of THEM would
				have liked to have been. Today, I'm sure, there are fewer that would
				want to be, because of the number of "United States Americans" that
				seem to be totally (or should I say "conservatively") whacko! ;-)

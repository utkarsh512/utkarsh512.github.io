Yes, such an approach to this out of control law and order issue is
akin to putting an anorexic on a strict calorie reduced diet.

This view is the result of RW propaganda and a complete lack of
understanding what the left advocates. The fact that RW policies over
the last 50 years have created the dystopian society we are now living
in should be enough to convince even the most conservative RW
ideologes. When 3 people own more than half the population it's
obvious something is amiss.

I couldn’t roll my eyes more... I read through a few of the
arguments... I believe leftism understand humans behavior in society.
We all know that a society where the differences between your neighbor
and yourself are too big lead to violence and chaos. Why don’t we
spare the death and tragedy and share a little? It isn’t about caring
about others but protecting yourself and your family. The minimum
would be education and health. That’s it.

		No really I wouldn't. Both the left and the right have negative
		issues, they need, to work on.

			Both the left and the right have negative issues Yes they do, but the
			only reason there is a left is because the ordinary people who were
			being oppressed by authoritarian, monarchist regimes sat down and
			thought critically about why their lives were shit. The left -- I mean
			the true left, rather than liberal capitalists -- believes the
			favouritism capitalism shows to the rich eventually leads to something
			called class , and that the lower class, which does all the hard work,
			is exploited by the higher class, which takes all the profit. The left
			also believes that the government is the great protector of this way
			of life, and despite the pack of lies people in your country get every
			day about the left, the left wants to get rid of the government.
			Conversely, the right is about tradition, order, authority, oppression
			of the working class and it depends upon the state to enforce its
			interests. The best proof of that is history. Your country is further
			to the right politically than any other in the developed world, and it
			has always had a strong central government to hold that system in
			place.

			It isn't an exaggeration when I say that the right wants to enslave
			you. It wants a society just like this one where everybody is forced
			to work. The only change in 300 years is that they have taken the
			chains off. You're still a slave. You have to work. You aren't give
			another choice except death, just like the old days.

									6 years is a long time. 6 years of my posts would give you plenty of

									is banal Cold War propaganda from the mid 1980s. It's all infantile
									shock porn about how Communism killed ten squillion people. It is
									offensive to my intelligence when you try to persuade people that
									capitalism is somehow a morally superior system, because at least 9
									million people starve to death every single year in countries which
									identify as capitalist. America is the wealthiest country on planet
									Earth and yet there are 11 million children there who don't even have
									enough to eat. It gets boring reading your right wing anti-socialist
									propaganda bud, and it gets boring real quick. Rightwingers point out
									the horrors of Stalinism, yet forget the human misery their favoured
									economic model was built on Don’t get me wrong: regimes that took the
									name “communist” – from Stalin’s to Pol Pot’s – committed unspeakable,
									monstrous crimes. But for the right, a revival of interest in Marx’s
									pre-Stalinist vision of communism is the most striking and chilling
									example of its own collapsing ideological supremacy: “communism” is
									synonymous with tens of millions of deaths and nothing else.
									Capitalism, by contrast, is presented as a largely bloodless,
									blameless engine of human prosperity. The story of capitalism is more
									complicated than that. If you want to read effusive praise of
									capitalism, you’ll find it in Marx and Engels’ Communist Manifesto:
									the revolutionary dynamism of the capitalists, they wrote, had created
									“wonders far surpassing Egyptian pyramids, Roman aqueducts, and Gothic
									cathedrals”. But capitalism is an economic system drenched in the
									blood of countless millions. https://www.theguardian.com/

																		If we take the gun away from that shooting is there still a dead
																		person? Yes. There just isn't a shooting. That's because the killer is
																		still there but without a gun. Since guns don't kill people, if you
																		remove the killer from the shooting, then the gun remains but there is

can't be real because natural selection can not create a totally new
species, it's not that powerful". there's no more evidence of this
then there is of the opposing theory that it is possible the person
arguing against evolution uses it as an argument though because it

	Both the left and the right are stupid. Your fallacy is: the false
	equivalence. Assuming that if one side is stupid, the other side must
	necessarily also be stupid. The fact of the matter is that it is
	people who are stupid, because they are living in a system which
	enslaves them with invisible chains. The left was invented by people
	who were intelligent enough to see the invisible chains, and because
	you are not that intelligent, you accuse the left of being stupid. And
	that, in large part, is why the world is so fucked. It lives in right
	wing societies and cultures which use and exploit people for their
	labour, but thanks to evolution a lot of smart people have seen
	through this for what it is. Not wanting to see the end of its
	rulership the right has spent the last century attacking the left and
	saturating culture with propaganda designed to convince you that
	capitalism is like socialism (i.e. fair, just, equal opportunity
	etc...) and socialism is like capitalism (hierarchical, oppressive,
	authoritarian etc...). Stupid is the default condition of people when
	it comes to politics.

					there's no balancing it out with anything. That ignorance has been

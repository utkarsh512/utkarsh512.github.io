This was the only sane and wise outcome. Obama is an experienced and

a political crisis waiting to happen.

		What does him being white have to do with Yulia's response? I happen

I am deeply saddend by the Obama win tonight. There is no sense
stressing over it because I know things will get worse. What I really
don't understand is why so many people voted for him without a clue as
to the suffering we in the US will undergo in the next four years.
Here is my plan of action to stave off a total melt down in MY world.
1. Today I am going to convert all of my investment accounts (please
read as 401ks) from stock based investments to cash equivalents only.
Hopefully I can find cash equivalents that are not backed by the US
Dollar because it isn't going to be worth anything in the very near
future. 2. I am going to start living healthier because God forbid I
get sick under Obama care...you get kinda sick and they are not going
to do anything for you...but, If you get terminally ill they will
throw millions at you. 3. I am going to start a systematic anti-obama
campaign like my friend Hellno did for the last four years. We won't
have to worry about Obama, but we will have to worry about these crazy
people who vote without thought. We need to change that! 4. I am going
to pray I don't lose my job...but what the hell...if I do, I can just
spend more time on CreateDebate. 5. I am going to go buy a weapon and
lots of supplies to make sure I am ready for the melt down that is
coming. It is going to be crazy bad. I must defend my family and our
supplies. There will be more, but this is a good start!

	1. if those investments had been in the DOW, they would have doubled
	since March 9, 2009 2. without Obamacare, a company had a profit
	motive for finding a way to recind your coverage when you got sick 3.
	disagreement does not evince an absence of thought 4. more than 5
	million private sector jobs and counting 5. buy all the guns you want,
	and while you do take notice that Obama has lessened gun restrictions
	(allowing guns in national parks and in the luggage compartment of
	Amtrak trains)
	[Posted by JustIgnoreMe at 2012-11-07T04:28:23+00:00 - Side: Cool.]

		1. Obama did nothing to bring the Dow back from almost depression
		levels. It was going to happen on its own. 2. My company has stated
		that when Obamacare is in full effect, they are dropping our regular
		insurance and we get to shift to non-insured Obamacare. 3. They were
		not thinking about how voting with emotion does not get the job done.
		4. Obama has not created any jobs. He is playing with the numbers.
		Look at all of the people who stopped looking and the almost doubling
		of people on public assisstance. 5. I wasn't referring to gun
		control...Frankly I don't care about gun control. The reason I said I
		would buy a gun is to protect my family when our economy melts down
		and people can't find food for their families. They are going to
		resort to crime. I want to be prepared.

			1. Of course, the President can only collapse the economy, right? If
			it doubles he had nothing to do with it... 2. Companies do not have to
			offer insurance right now, but they do; cost is not the only reason
			employers offer health insurance. It is likely that your company was
			exaggerating, though even if they weren't, having exchanges available
			to those whose employers do not offer insurance (and the self-
			employed, etc.) is a better option than that which existed prior to
			Obamacare. Also, if you lost your job and could not afford COBRA
			insurance you would lose coverage of preexisting conditions in the old
			system. And insurance companies have to spend 80-85% of premiums on
			actual medical costs instead of commercials and other overhead. And
			plans won't have annual or lifetime caps. And it limits waiting
			periods for coverage to 90 days. And, and, and.... 3. Or, maybe they
			were thinking that the Republican House of Representatives has been
			intentionally obstructive even to ideas they used to support. And yet
			- Unemployment has gone from a high of 10% to now under 8% - housing
			starts and home values are up - car companies are thriving - the
			deficit went down $200 Billion dollars this year - consumer confidence
			is up Or, maybe they like the President's steadfastness about getting
			out of Afghanistan Or, maybe they thought Romney had changed every
			position he has ever had and was willing to lie about Jeep moving jobs
			to China - therefore they decided they could not trust him. Or, maybe
			they thought his mathematically impossible economic "plan" was just a
			list of mutually exclusive bullet points Or, maybe they thought Romney
			was not deft at articulating a coherent foreign policy Or, maybe they
			thought that he would appoint justices to the supreme court similar to
			Scalia Or, maybe they thought he would be beholden to the Tea Party
			wing of Republicans (and the Republican party platform) which wants
			the 14th Amendment to the constitution to apply to blastocysts - and
			would criminalize in-vitro fertilization and most hormonal birth
			control and force women to have the children of their rapist. or,
			maybe they were just happy or sad that day and voted based on
			emotion... 4. He didn't "create" them in the same way Romney wasn't
			going to "create 12 million new jobs". When he came into office the
			economy was losing 800,000 private sector jobs a month - over the last
			32 months (of consecutive private sector growth) the economy has added
			5 million jobs - I only require that you assign as much credit for the
			positive as you would blame for the negative. 5. which economic
			indicator do you look at that shows a melting down of the economy
			(besides the Fox News oh-shit meter)?

	An anti obama champaign huh? Why not just move? I mean alot of

I'm not happy but I wanna say one thing because I know lots of people
on the right are going to say "oh it's because of voter fraud he
cheated etc." he won. That's it. You deserve who you vote for.

I agree with Jake there you get who you vote for but when I looked at
Romney and Obama it's not like America had a lot of choice, I dont
like Obama he reminds me a lot of Tony Blair and look how he fucked
Britain up but at the same time Romney did'nt seem a lot better and
his chasing after Ted Nugent for support is not a good sign that this
guy knows how to run a Country. I think it'll be interesting to see
how it all turns out, my guess is it'll be messy and I wish luck to
all Americans, God knows your gonna need it.

That white people are more open minded than people of color. If you

whites closer to high 50s

I an disappointed by the re-election of Barrack Obama. The fact that
he brainwashed half the country into voting for him amazes me. The
entire election Obama and his team of socialist have been telling us
the country is doing great and the economy is fine. But now, after the
election, all I hear about is the impending fiscal cliff and how the
economy could be even worse if this isn't resolved. And all Obama and
the extremely democratic mainstream media can do is blame those evil
republicans. While republicans are trying to fix this country, the
democrats do nothing but blame others and destroy this country. As an
American I fear for the future of this country.

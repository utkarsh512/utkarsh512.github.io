You have to be a boiling mad retard to be a Socialist. It's the
philosophical position of 4 year old children.

It's funny you say that, because I can be called one for all
intensive purposes and I am also not particularly proficient in
mathematics. I do however know history fairly well and how I know how
cause and effect works relative to social development. That is to say,
I know why things are the way they are, and I know where things can go
in the future. One thing I know is things will not be the same. If the
system you advocate is one that is currently being employed you have
already lost.

	The one being implemented created the richest nation in history, and
	the biggest Communist country had to implement parts of it in order to
	survive! Looks like you DON'T know history buddy! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

Seems like ol' Trumpy misnamed his slogan. Considering that most of
our "friends" around the world, most of Africa, Australia, The
Netherlands, Canada, Mexico, Central America, Europe, The Balkans, on
and on don't like/trust U.S. anymore, don't specifically trust King
Donald, his slogan should have said "Make America Gross Again". Trump
and Congressional Republicans ... naked? EEEEEWWWW!

	Yes, and when these countries that now do not like us or trust us
	needs something really bad, they will come crawling back begging us to
	help. Notice how not one country has returned their foreign aid money
	back to us. Guess what, none of them will. Who cares it they do not
	like us, what are they going to do, shut off trade with us, not help
	us in a war. Watch how fast they like us again when we tell them we
	are pulling out of NATO and Russia can have the continent all to
	themselves.

	Crazy Al from Road Island are you again saying that Americans don't
	have The Right To Vote unless they vote for Progressives ? Hey 81 year
	old go take a nap and get your daily diet of CNN !

It is utterly shameless that the party insiders who fought
desperately to stop him in the primaries later chose to shield him
from scrutiny and ride his gravy train. But hey, this won't be the end
of the Republicans. Sure, they'll lose bad in the next election,
because they deserve to. But Americans are still so stupid they'll
just keep flip flopping between which of the two dominant parties they
vote into power. We'll get a round of Democrat control and then we'll
just put the Republicans back. It's insanity.

	Boy from Boston is it now that the D.C. Elites that you so love need
	to elect a President ? Boy from Boston Trump was supposedly a loser of
	the Presidential election according to the Progressive Media and that
	worked ? So now Republicans will lose badly in the next election?
	Let's quote the Boy from Boston : "But Americans are still so stupid
	they'll just keep flip flopping between which of the two dominant
	parties they vote into power. We'll get a round of Democrat control
	and then we'll just put the Republicans back. It's insanity." Boy what
	happened thought you Progressives were about the Right to Vote and
	cried voter suppression when you lose ? Your mask has been removed
	just admit you are all about suppressing voters instead of fooling
	yourself you are about the Right to Vote Boy go change your rugrats
	diapers !

	The insanity part is that you see the total failure of Democrats for
	eight years and you STILL voted for more of the same. YOU ARE THE
	STUPID AMERICAN WHO SUPPORTS FAILURE! Democrats are the Party that
	deserved to be beat, and the Repubican Party is showing why they
	deserved to win. Their policies are light years apart. It's socialism
	versus capitalism on display for all to see! The winner to any honest
	intelligent person is obvious. You are every bit the career Liberal as
	i always say you are. Try looking around at what just happened to our
	economy in less than one year, and what happened to it for eight long
	years under Business hating democrats. LEARN! GROW!

Watching the Left these days is like watching bazzarro world. No
matter how great Trump and the GOP is doing, these looney people keep
playing the fools. I mean COME ON, when do you understand that
constantly denying our nation's progress, since Trump was elected,
makes you look like total idiots. Is this your strategy in the mid
term elections? LOL, please keep it up! As Americans start getting
bigger paychecks, as their 401k's explode, as the Black unemployment
rate drops below 7% (A RECORD LOW), as jobs are out there for any able
bodied working man to find, as ISIS is on the run, etc. etc. etc., you
keep right on playing the obstructionist fools you are and we will see
those election results. Everything Trump said he woud do, he is doing.
Our economy is doing exactly what economies do after eight years of
socialistic paralysis. Economies always take off when the socialist
loonies can no longer do damage to our job creators. What's so comical
is watching the Democrat Party and those on the Left on this debate
site pretending everything is falling apart. Here is what has
transpired since Trump win.... He instantly got rid of needless
regulations holding back business... Dems scream RACIST NAZI! He
instantly won battles against ISIS, destroying their strong holds...
Dems scream RACIST NAZI! He passed the first major tax overhaul for
the working man in 30 years... Dems scream RACIST NAZI! He stopped the
mandates forcing Americans to buy worthless expensive health
insurance... Dems scream RACIST NAZI! He stopped our Government from
forcing Americans with a conscience to pay for abortions in other
nations... Dems scream RACIST NAZI! What the Left is doing is
paramount to if the Republicans screamed NIGGER everytime Obama did
anything. Can you imagine if the Repubicans treated Obama with that
type of childish judgmental hate? Keep it up Democrats. I want you to
keep talking about Trump's locker room talk, his past relationships
with women, what he might have said in closed door meetings, etc.
etc., and whie the rest of normal Americans enjoy the good life, you
can keep crying wolf. Americans are seeing what you actually care
about... and it's not their wellbeing. You care about your Big
Government Socialistic ideology no matter what a failure Obama proved
it to be. Bury your head in the sand and scream RACIST NAZI over and
over and over like little spoiled children having temper tantrums. I
realize you have little else you can do other than admitting how good
things are going. You lack the character to ever do that, even though
it would be the one thing Americans would applaud, and show you
actually cared about them. It's fun watching the failure of Socialism
being so clearly shown to the world. Obama and Trump are polar
opposites. Socialism versus Capitalism..... there has never been a
more clear demonstration of their effects on a nation.

	What the Left is doing is paramount to if the Republicans screamed

	treated Obama with that type of childish judgmental hate? Interesting
	point, though I do think there's a rather large difference between
	calling someone racist and being blatantly racist yourself.

		Calling someone Nigger would be a racist thing to say, and calling
		someone a racist or nazi is a judgmental intolerant thing to do. My
		point was that both things are bad, but the Left never sees their
		hypocrisy. They would be outraged if Repubicans had treated Obama like
		the Democrats are treating Trump.

			calling someone a racist or nazi is a judgmental intolerant thing to

			hypocrisy. It's the difference between being outright racist about
			someone, and overreacting towards someone's political opinions. You
			can't seriously think that calling a black man the most racist,
			derogatory term you can call them is equivilant to calling someone a
			racist. They would be outraged if Repubicans had treated Obama like
			the Democrats are treating Trump. ... but the Republicans did treat
			Obama the same way. I'm not saying it's right, but don't pretend that
			Obama didn't receive the exact same treatment during his presidency.

				Is it time for ignore already? If you are going to try and equate the
				Gop's opposition to Obamas Liberal policies, to what the Democrat
				party is doing to Trump, then it is ignore time! The Left is attacking
				Trump personally. They are calling him a racist, a nazi, a hater of
				women, etc. etc. blah blah blah blah. There is no comparison. The GOP
				did not fixate on making non stop personal attacks against Obama.

					The GOP did not fixate on making non stop personal attacks against
					Obama. They literally ran a campaign saying that he wasn't an American
					citizen.

						No, a few Republicans did this, not the entire GOP!!!!!!! Even if
						they had, questioning a person's citizenship is not derogatory and is
						not calling him a racist and nazi. GET REAL!

							Even if they had, questioning a person's citizenship is not
							derogatory I'm sorry, what? Not derogatory? The whole birther movement
							was formed around the fact that Obama wasn't a white man. It was made
							to undermine him and use his race against him.

								So you say it is derogatory to suggest some person came from another
								nation? Do you hate foreigners that much?

									I think it's derogatory to try and undermine and disqualify a
									presidential candidate by saying he's from Kenya simply because of the
									colour of his skin.

Trump's approval rating keeps going up with blacks. The Democrat
Party is done. If Trump hit's 15% or higher, it is mathematically
impossible for the Democrats to win. No clothes Schumer, Pelosi and
the Clintons have no clothes to the point of pornography.

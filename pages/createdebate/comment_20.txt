Outlaw (well Bronto sock puppet account with a NL analysis confidence
level of around 96%) is just like Bronto: He's a snowflake. He is
incapable of emotionally handling the idea that people disagreeing
with him; and doesn't have the intellectual capacity to express
himself or his position in any meaningful way: so he chooses not to.
As he is triggered by the idea that he could be wrong, most of his
"contribution" is to post an argument and then repeat it over and over
and over again whilst ignoring everything anyone says to the contrary.
Kind of like the "la la la I'm not listening strangely". Most of the
time, he doesn't even bother pretending that he is arguing or engaging
in a debate: and simply regurgitates the same false propoganda and
rhetoric as he does with his other accounts. Indeed, he's not here for
any meaningful date, but for a combination of attention, and self
reassurance: lashing out at people who contradict his position, and
trollinf to make people angry so he can pretend that they are
irrational and dismiss them. He's just like the idiot protesters at
colleges, except he's not as smart, has arguably worse anger and
emotional issues, and is probably 20 years older. It's actually pretty
hilarious! Especially when he has a meltdown and sends you angry PM's!

	Bwahahahahaha! He thinks I'm outlaw. Excellent.... "Anger" seems to
	be ram's word of the day. It seems to be on his mind. Might wanna
	gobble some prozak ram. Your butthurt is showing.

		You're a repeated compulsive liar; I doubt anything you just claimed
		is true. And yes, I know who you're sock puppet accounts are. Feel
		free to start denying it; it was funny when all of your accounts all
		started to deny it at in different threads within the same hour :) I
		find it cute; it shows everyone (and it is more than obvious) how
		desperate you are for an audience! I'm happy to be that audience for
		you!

										Please. Your accounts appear and post one a time, repeatedly like

										use the same speech patterns, language patterns, derogatory words at
										the same frequency; start making the same styles of arguments about
										pretty esoteric things at the same time, you all started complaining
										at me calling you puppet accounts in the same hour period. You pretty
										much use the same argument method and tactics, and exactly the same
										failures of logic. Every other republican on here does things
										differently from those same 4 accounts you post from. So please, just

																					Well there's a lot to it being true, such as ramshutu here
																					consistently interacting with bronto like Nom does (this account is
																					more polite but just as sardonic). Then there's the fact that Nom for
																					some reason 'never joined' DA but Ramshutu joined right around when DA
																					was mentioned by Mingiwuwu. Ramshutu account on DA refers to glue
																					sniffing around the same time you mention it on Nom Chomsky
																					https://www.debateart.com/forum/topics/ 1979?page=3&amp;post_number=67
																					amshutu is a disciplined psychopath but he has the same drive and
																					baseline persona as Nom does in his raw sociopath form. They both
																					spend equal amounts of time online and have identical political views
																					(the only difference may lie in 9/11 conspiracy). Ramshutu speaks in
																					British English and is either British or Canadian (he lies about one
																					or the other here, there etc and has slipped not being British by
																					posting videos that weren't allowed in Britain but then that would
																					also happen if you always use VPN and forget that when your slang etc
																					refer to British things, it's kind of telling. They have precisely the
																					same attitude to revealing anything about themselves IRL; they lie or
																					hide it. It is also clear they both LOVE TO prey on other sociopaths,
																					much like Nom does. It's like an addiction to him to leap upon other
																					people as calculating as he is and this is even more blatant in his
																					Ramshutu persona. Also, I noticed that Nom is always offline when
																					Ramshutu is (and since both are online so often, that is very very
																					rare and yet it's every single time).

																						So basically; your evidence is that weâ€™re both liberal sarcastic
																						Brits who donâ€™t want to publically dox themselves? Better start
																						lighting up the pitchforks! - Iâ€™m a Brit living in Canada, you cretin.
																						- the glue is a reference to semen, not glue sniffing, you idiot. -
																						Iâ€™ve used the same account name here, on Dart and DDO for a long time.
																						Youâ€™re just a paranoid schizophrenic; or perhaps just butthurt and
																						looking for patterns. Why not run our text through a comparative AI to

As far as outlaw is concerned, his arguments are almost predefined,
you can be sure to see some lmfaos and the word left being abused,
just like any other addiction. To try to actually take him seriously
based on what he's said so far would be stupid to try, but
nonetheless, let's hope he makes sense of his arguments someday.

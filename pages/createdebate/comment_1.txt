	According to the FRAUD all people are free to marry and it didn't
	even bring up the 14th Amendment ! Is that because you are just trying
	to keep the PROMISE ?

		Free to marry? So, can a child marry another child or an adult marry
		a 12 year old child? How about if a man gets 21 women pregnant and has
		21 children, can he marry them all and give each child a married mom
		and dad?

	Excon(1423) As a patriot it is liberty you seek. Freedom is the first
	Amendment made on the patriot’s liberty granted to them by an Axiom of
	GOD under United State found by Constitution. Point blank any person
	of color and breath does not ever want to be free. Give us liberty in
	any way, shape, or form, not freedom. The liberty of speech,
	representation by common defense. Free has no self-value to which as
	people, as men, as woman, humans hold independence dear. It is a
	presumption by interpretation that self-value can be added to the word
	free, as any free state in truth holds no self-value. The word Free
	hides one and only one cost, free means the loss or right of self-
	value. Only an object such as what is owned can be free. Many black
	Americans are in fact not free, and a republic will riotously argue
	never shall be just free, by their service to the republic in time of
	war they have been granted liberty. Even when they themselves do not
	understand when, why, and how. This is the nation of Liberty and
	Justice for all, the bitterness is that any impartial justice does not
	have as sweet sound like freedom, or insight precedent of fortune, and
	does not look like a sunny open plain. Liberty has been paid in blood,
	sweat, pain, and loss, its cost knot hidden.

		It ks true and trying to comlare gay behaving people with blacks who
		were brought his with a price is just sick. That price is too high.
		Many have asked how come the blacks did not go back to Africa when
		they were freed. Where in Africa? That is like telling an Italian to
		go to Yugolslavia, but the Italian does not know he is Italian and
		what the language is. There are 53 countries in Africa and 53
		different people and 1100 languages spoken on that continent.

	You are jhhst biased in your own mind. You just put blacks and women
	in the same class as a behavior. Do you care if pedophiles are free?
	How about incest couples and polygamist? Or, the zoophile who is
	attracted to his pet? No, you are just a liberal and you have no clue.

I care because I am a firm believer in civil rights and in the
principle you should let other people live their own lives. Marriage
has legal and financial implications which can really help gay
couples. And there really is NO downside. Heterosexuals can still
marry whom THEY want. Heterosexuals can go adopt kids if they're so
concerned about gays doing it. Heterosexuals can leave or look the
other way if they don't want to look at a gay couple holding hands.
And religious people can still look forward to their eternal reward
and leave it to God to give a gay couple whatever they deserve. No
harm to the religious person then either. No harm to anyone, really.
The only harm, right now, is gay couples building lives together don't
have all the same rights and privileges as their straight
counterparts. That needs to be rectified.

It amazing to me that most of the people against gay marriage are the
ones who want the government to stay out of THEIR lives. The ones who
want NO regulations. The ones who want the freedom to do as THEY
please. .....Can you say: "hypocrisy"????

	TO be fair, and I'm just putting this out there. Marriage is
	typically a religious institution. The government does give benefits
	and rights to those who are married which is why I fight for same sex
	marriage. I think if that was taken out and Union were allowed by the
	government to get those same rights and churches were able to decide
	if they wanted same sex to marry in the eyes of God, maybe that
	wouldn't be so bad. There are a good amount of churches who are
	forward in their thinking and allow same sex marriage, and more are
	changing their stagnant ways to allow it as well.

																	Ugh SO close to actually being able to have a conversation with you.
																	Dangit I got my hopes up again. marriage is typically a religious
																	ceremony Again yes, show me proof that most marriages don't occur in
																	church or with a church official. If you show me I will correct
																	myself. Forget the church Ok. Taking out the church there are Civil
																	Unions. Again though, stating that marriage is a religious ceremony
																	isn't negating completely the fact that some people go to a courthouse
																	and get a Civil Union there. Government and laws come into play when a
																	man and a woman get together. Get together as in sex? No. Just having
																	sex with someone doesn't give them the rights to my medical and dental
																	health insurance. Just being with someone as bf/gf doesn't give them
																	the legal ability to make decisions on my health in the event I am
																	unable to. Marriage is a legal status usually recognized by every
																	state and nation around the world. Civil Unions gives many of the same
																	protections, not always all, but are only available at a state level.
																	Here is some information: http://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/
																	article/ marriage-compared-to-civil-unions.html Maybe this will help.

I personally don't care. I think the people that care do so because
marriage was historically only a religious phenomenon, whereas
nowadays there are also secular marriages.

Personally, I believe that people should choose who they marry. I'm
not talking about a man having multiple wives or a person trying to
marry a thirteen year old. This is not a gate way to have man kind
getting married to dogs. This is letting a man, or woman, choose to
marry whomever they choose. As long as they are consenting adults.

We are asked to be a witness on an officially documented that becomes
public record, refusal is the separation made clear by objection. If
we do not object we are incriminated into a crime by agreement. That
is not described to us by the people who are publicly plagiarizing the
term marriage. This crime becomes part of public record. In all
fairness a witness should be given a common defense to Constitutional
separation. Two additional titles for likelihood to substitute the
title marriage, BiniVir and Unosmulier they are impartial separations
based on basic principle and legal precedent.

I don't care. The benefits are needed so unless they want to take
those government benefits out of marriage and just make it a union
then marriage should be between two consenting adults. Those who
aren't for it are usually projecting their own issues into someone
else's business.

Marriage (even if you are doing it for religious reasons) is
essentially choosing to be with one person for the rest of your life,
and receiving a government approved document that states this fact. If
two gay people want to be together for the rest of their lives, they
will be, whether marriage is legal or not. So if that's the case, why
should gay people not have the same opportunity as straight people?
Additionally, how does the concept of two people of the same gender
getting married, in ANY way, hurt you personally? Difference in
opinion should never impede on law or equality.

Don't ask. Don't tell. Don't care. The only people who have any
reason to care are the people involved, provided the only people
involved are consenting adults. I have a very conservative view. I
think I am typical in this. Most conservatives I have ever heard talk
about it (except the religious crazies) also don't care. I don't
particularly care about anyone's individual choice unless: -It is
happening on my property. -I have to pay for it. -It creates an
involuntary obligation on anyone's part. -It impacts the physical
space of anyone against his/her will.

Do you think you have the right to keep men from having 30 wives? Are
you starting to grasp the slippery slope? If you force every State to
allow Gay marriage, then you must allow every other unnatural group to
do the same. Where will it end? The obvious normal and best marriage
is between one man and one woman. It has been the best common sense
way to raise our children.
[Posted by FromWithin at 2017-06-12T02:44:48+00:00 - Side: Because it is gross]

	"Do you think you have the right to keep men from having 30 wives?" -
	No. In fact, polygamy is illegal in the US. But like EVERYTHING else
	that eventually becomes illegal, people find a loophole to do it
	anyway (as the "Sister Wives" show). This day and age, it is next to
	impossible to completely rid the country of a social aspect by making
	it illegal. "Are you starting to grasp the slippery slope? If you
	force every State to allow Gay marriage, then you must allow every
	other unnatural group to do the same. Where will it end?" - This is
	starting to sound way too much like a conspiracy theory. How does
	allowing one social group a privilege they were denied before, connect
	to letting others do the same? Plus, what exactly is marriage? It's
	you, basically vowing to be in a relationship with the same person
	until you're dead, and declaring that with a government document. If
	two gay people want to be together for the rest of their lives,
	they're GOING to be together for the rest of their lives. And without
	having to give up 50% of their money to the other person. If they're
	going to be together anyway, what purpose does inequality of marriage
	serve? "The obvious normal and best marriage is between one man and
	one woman." - This is an opinion. There is no social situation where
	you can say something is the "best" of something, and have it be
	purely factual. So if this is your opinion, fine. Opinions aren't
	chosen. So here's what you do... Don't marry another man. "It has been
	the best common sense way to raise our children." - I know several gay
	couples who have adopted kids, and are excellent parents. The kids are
	well taken care of, learning moral values, and being prepared for
	life, like any other family. Additionally, is your argument ACTUALLY
	out of concern for children being brought up in the world? What if two
	gay people want to get married and choose to never involve having a
	kid? Then is it okay with you? Or are you taking the marginal case and
	using it as an excuse to try and justify your argument as a whole?

					Oh, I understand. I was a teacher for years, and I agree that schools
					have expanded the scope of what they teach to include subjects that
					are not (or should not be) in the curriculum. It is inexcusable, often
					invasive, and totally inefficient. When 10th graders have 4th grade
					reading levels, and 11th graders need a calculator to add 7+5 (true
					stories from my career) then we have no time to add anything to the
					curriculum. Part of the problem is that at even 1 hour/weekday for 9
					months, (187 hours) I had many students who spent more time with me
					than with their parents. From 1st to 12th grade, kids spend somewhere
					between 20-26% of their waking hours at school. Despite the fact that
					the parents are responsible for the other 74-80% of the time, too many
					do not think that means they should be teaching their own kids three
					quarters of what they learn about the world. Honestly, the fact that
					so many parents abdicate so much of their responsibilities is what
					creates the vulnerability to indoctrination, and supplies the
					opportunity for schools to indoctrinate. When kids show up with little
					or no value system, or no constantly accessible role models, teachers
					fill the void, whether they are trying to or not. By contrast, when
					kids show up to school having learned about that other 80% of life
					from their parents, grandparents, religious leaders, work, etc., then
					they have context that enables them to discriminate sensibly in their
					thinking and learning. If you spend enough real time with your kids
					(not just watching TV) doing things that model your values and grow
					them into people who know and understand your beliefs, then your kids
					will be resistant/impervious to the effects of school scope creep and
					propaganda. Don't worry. As long as you are doing your job as a
					parent, the schooling cannot possibly undermine what you teach your
					kids. That only happens when parents do not fulfill their obligation
					to do the hard work of raising their kids.

			Thanks for the response. 1 - Actually, I was trying to use a humorous
			metaphor to point out how ridiculous it has always been for there to
			be laws regulating people's private lives, and private choices. 2 -I
			was also taking a swipe at Leftists and Democrats for pretending they
			are in favor of Americans actually being free, when the evidence shows
			they are against freedom. The left routinely implements policies that
			impede our freedom to live our lives unhampered by unnecessary
			government policies, intervention, support, and the attendant taxes
			through which we are forced to pay for the choices of others. 3 - I
			see no reason for (adult) gay marriage to stay illegal. What I want is
			as few laws as absolutely necessary to keep the peace and protect
			individual freedoms. What I am in favor of is NOT ADDING a
			law/control, but rather of REMOVING one. (Personally, I think it is a
			problem, or at least unnecessary, that the government is involved in
			marriage at all.) We (adult Americans) do not need the government to
			play mommy to tell us to get off the roof and go take a bath
			(metaphorically speaking). 4 - I do not see how you actually answered
			the question. You conflated gay marriage no longer being illegal with
			a propaganda campaign in favor of it. The question was about the
			former, but you answered in response to the latter. Would your view
			change if the propaganda were not part of the deal? I think the whole
			propaganda campaign about what is morally good, normal, etc. that
			happens in our public schools (and other venues) is a bad idea and
			inexcusably invasive. Health/Biology classes should stick to the
			reproductive biology, &amp; leave the values alone, regardless of the
			viewpoint. In California, I taught life science, including sex ed,
			without ever referring to morals, social norms, etc.. I just explained
			organ &amp; cell function, DNA, gestation stages, and diseases.
			Gametes &amp; Zygotes (meiosis) are hard enough to get kids to
			understand without adding extra crap about morals, etc. to distract
			them. Moreover, it does not matter which value set a
			curriculum/teacher inserts; some kid's parents are going to have a
			fit. It is insanity for public school programs ever to touch on
			people's private lives. That road leads only to pain and lawyers. I
			also think having an LGBTXYZ pride month is ridiculous and
			unnecessary. We have laws against violence, theft, and harassment (for
			any reason), and so long as those are properly enforced, the free
			market will take care of the rest. 5 - Unfortunately the word
			"sanction" is its own antonym. It means both "officially/publically
			approve", and "impose a penalty" so I am not sure of your position on
			condiment dancing.

				First of all, they have already had Gay awareness days in schools,

				awareness propaganda. That is the stuff that bothers me and millions
				of other Americans. The Left is bent on programming our children's
				minds, from kindergarten on up, to political correctness. What you
				described as biology class is just as it should be but the Left with
				every decade are pushing the envelope, especially when the teacher's
				union leans to the Left. I conflated Gay marriage with a propaganda
				campaign because I have followed politics for many years. For 40 years
				our nation has been brow beaten by the Left. Doctors who once declared
				homosexuality a mental issue, now are threatened with law suits if
				they dare say such things. Even if Gays are born that way, which is
				not even close to being a proven fact, does not mean it's not a mental
				disorder of some type. The only reason every state was forced to
				change their marriage laws (against the will of the people in many
				states), was because the activist Left pushed it through after decades
				of law suits. Our laws should never be forced to change under threat
				of law suits by a vocal minority of Gay activists, Liberal media,
				Liberal politicians along with their appointed Liberal Judges.
				Important change in our State laws should be a majority decision by
				people in those States, not done by a few activist Judges. If you
				can't see thew slippery slope of Poitical correctness, then wow! Do

					1 - Teacher union LEADERSHIP (none of whom are teachers) leans left.
					Most teachers are centrists, and scatter to both sides. The many tens

					most teachers' beliefs &amp; views. That is REALLY screwed up, and why
					I hated being in a union. NEVER believe a political ad that says some
					number of union members support or oppose something. The add is a lie.
					2 - We obviously agree on the propaganda problem. 3 - Regarding your
					slippery slope you keep mentioning, you don't seem to know where we
					actually are on that hill. The slope started by instituting laws you
					approve of. Those laws are what led to what you now disapprove. The
					slope started at the top of the hill that involved letting government
					into people's personal lives. This included approving heterosexual
					marriage and making gay marriage illegal. It sounds like most of your
					problems with gay marriage are really problems with the government
					being involved in any social relationships, including all marriage.
					The idea that the government's job was to intervene in social
					relationships, arbitrate what are and are not valid reasons for people
					to decide with whom to associate continued further down the slope with
					Jim Crow laws passed entirely by Democrats in the 1800's (meant to
					segregate people), and continued further down the hill with de-
					segregation/integration laws, passed mostly by Democrats from the
					1950's to the 1970's. We are at least halfway down the hill by now,
					and fascism is at the bottom. The Democrats and leftists keep pushing
					us further down the slope. The Republicans (who are not particularly
					conservative) keep saying things were better just a little further up
					the slope, but they don't want to go back to the top. NOBODY needs the
					government to help them decide who to like, or with whom to be friends
					or engage in commerce, or what types of marriage are okay.

						I agree with many of the thngs you say, but I disagree with what you
						say concerning Government creation of marriage. Since the beginning of
						time, we have had marriages between men and women because that is the
						natural normal way we are designed. Have you noticed how the animal
						kingdom works? There are no Gay animals unless you swallow the lies
						and false examples the Left speaks to. There should be Gay dogs, cats,
						horses, etc. etc. etc., but we see none. There are no animals who
						refuse to have sex with the opposite sex, and only have Gay sex! Yes,
						we have some animals that would have sex with anything that moves,
						such as a dog havng sex with your leg, but this is not homosexuality.
						For all the people who say we are just another animal, and have
						evolved, Homosexuality goes against everything we see in nature and
						the natural order of life. Evolution teaches that animals evolve
						traits that continues their species, not end it as Homosexuality
						would. Either we say it like it is, which would make Homosexuality an
						unatural disorder, or we say evolution could be a lie. With regards to
						what you keep saying about keeping Government out of our lives, I
						agree. But we do need basic laws to keep society functioning together
						and not living in anarchy with the anything goes mentality of the
						Left. I'm not talking about making moral laws, but society does need
						to lift up the natural normal order to life, and not lifting up
						unnatural abnormal things as being normal. Our children deserve
						better. We are watching our families fall apart form this promiscuous
						no fault anything goes culture. There are record numbers of children
						with no fathers at home. This is the reason society needs to keep some
						semblance of law and order, responsibility, accountability, etc.
						Society does need to lift up those moral values that create secure
						homes for our children. Family is the bed rock of society. Government
						is terrible at raising our children as we have seen. Children should
						have both a mother and father to grow up and become well adjusted
						adults. I believe Government should not force laws on every state that
						would weaken the foundation of marriage between a man and woman. Years
						ago, men who had attractions to other men still got married to women
						and raised families. The world did not come to an end. We don't all
						have to act on our attractions, especially if it is not a natural
						thing. Some men are attracted to having 30 wives but for society's
						sake, we say no. We have laws preventing pedophiles from acting on
						their attractions to children. We can not have a functioning culture
						without laws that lift up the natural, the normal, and the best of
						mankind. No one is talking about outlawing homosexuality. People
						should be free to do as they choose as long as they are not hurting
						others. But this does not mean Government should be sanctioning it.
						I'm glad to know you do not like unions. That pretty much ends any
						chance of you maybe someday dancing on a roof top covered with Creamy
						Balsamic Dressing.

	Are you starting to grasp the slippery slope? If you force every

	group to do the same. Where will it end? If the only argument against
	anything else is "you cant do that because its unnatural" then yes,
	absolutely. However things that have other arguments against them,
	such as bigamy, need not be allowed. The obvious normal and best
	marriage is between one man and one woman. So you think by making
	homosexual marriage illegal you will cause gay men to get married and
	have children? Newsflash: the word is overpopulated!! A few people NOT
	getting married and having kids is better for everyone.

Besides being an abomination, dirty, perversion, allowing legal
establishment of same sex couples and saying they are married gives
them legal and financial rights which cost money from employers and
taxpayers, forcing people to violate their conscience and support sin.
Homosexuals do not need any legal marriage, they can draw up their own
personal contracts for life or distribution of their estates or
whatever........but to give them the same tax and employment benefit
status as holy matrimony is forcing others to support their sin.
Marriage has it's privileges, and it should, as the family is the
foundation of society. The foundation is cracking, America has lost
it's mind to allow same sex perverts to call themselves married and
enjoy the benefits provided for the foundation of society which is the
family. Homosexuals did not engage in the battle for marriage rights
because of romantic ideals, it was for the money and they are forcing
me, by taxes and increased cost of goods as companies extend benefits
to spouses, to support their sin........adding to the coming judgement
of God on America as His anger builds against a country increasingly
turned away from and against Him.

	I agree. It is simply a behavior but we have been forced to use the

	right to procreate and have children? Why not? Opposite sex couples
	have that right? Should a lesbian have the legal right to impregnate
	another lesbian with her egg and procreate a child? A man can
	impregnate a woman and get her pregnant. How about a man who has 21
	children by 21 women, shouldn't he have the right to marry all 21 and
	give each child a normal home?

	THANK YOU! I appreciate that you are using material realities to
	support your argument instead of just leaning on arguments based on
	religious/moral tenets. I still do not care about other people's
	marriages, but I can totally see how your opinion is actually based in
	your objective self- interest and verifiable realities. It actually
	makes sense that you would care about same sex marriage, regardless of
	your religious beliefs. I have a different solution: 1 - Simplify and
	revise the tax code to make the number of dependents immaterial 2 -
	Eliminate the social welfare programs (including those that relate to
	marriage, like social security) 3 - Eliminate Government civilian
	employee pensions in favor of 401k style retirement systems. Most of
	the private sector has already done that, so marriage status is
	irrelevant for employer cost. 4 - Limit the employer obligation to
	whatever the employer &amp; employee voluntarily agree upon as
	incentive/compensation. That is between the employer and the employee.
	If both parties agree-fine. If the prospective employee does not like
	the parameters of the compensation package, he/she is free to find a
	different job where the employer has a different compensation/benefits
	offering. Employers will continue to use things like benefits packages
	to compete with each other for the employees they want/need.
	Personally, I don't buy into the judgment and religious fervor, and I
	certainly do not think who marries whom is the main crack in the
	American societal foundation. The flaw that is undermining our
	society's social health and future prosperity is unmarried/uncommitted
	parents. 40% of American kids are born out of wedlock, (50% of
	Hispanic kids &amp; 80% of black kids). Most of these kids are raised
	in single parent households most without fathers being more than
	nominally involved. A whopping 70-80% of inner city kids are being
	raised in single parent homes. (https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/
	three-simple-rules-poor-teens-should- follow-to-join-the-middle-
	class/) A large percentage of these are on government assistance.
	Related to the unmarried parent issue, over 21% of the US population
	is on Government assistance (https://www.census.gov/newsroom/ press-
	releases/2015/cb15-97.html). Most of these programs are primarily or
	exclusively for children and parents. By contrast,
	homosexuals/bisexuals are only 2-3% of the US population, and an even
	smaller percentage are in a same-sex marriage.
	(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/ volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/07/15/
	what-percentage-of-the-u-s-population-i s-gay-lesbian-or-bisexual/
	?utm_term=.2eb323eae18f) Gay marriage accounts for a much smaller
	financial impact to our society than do single parents accessing the
	public welfare programs. The direct social impact is also smaller, or
	would be were it not for the propaganda campaigns. Kids growing up
	without dad's is a much greater problem to society.

		All law is based on religious/moral tenets and can be wrong or right,
		just or unjust. People are faulty and when they establish laws not in
		accord with objective truth, those laws will be unjust and immoral. If
		you claim your idea of law is secular, then it is your own mind which
		is being placed on a pedestal as your god and you are being religious
		thinking you are justified by your own existence to be exonerated in
		death and exempt from the fire of Hell. It is your solution, by your
		own words, which is based on self-interest and not on objective truth.
		There is no such thing as "objective self-interest"; you are using an
		oxymoron which gives no credibility to your ideas as your personal
		self-interest may by and for yourself be considered objective while in
		direct conflict with my self-interest. Self-interest which is not
		subjective to truth is evil no matter how it may appear to be
		benevolent. All of your political ideas are changeable without
		objective truth. Whether you buy into "judgement and religious fervor"
		or not, in reality you are being religious trying to justify yourself
		to roam outside of the fire of Hell, and in reality you are failing.
		Sodomy, including all homosexuality, is a great evil which ruins lives
		and costs society a lot more money than what you are accounting for as
		it is spread primarily through molestation of children. Why you want
		to sweep garbage under the rug and promote your own ideas of
		righteousness is a mystery except for the natural tendency of sinners
		to exalt themselves thinking they have the right to exist outside of
		Hell. I'm sure whatever statistics you are presenting are homosexual
		propaganda in accordance with your "hear no evil, see no evil, speak
		no evil" ideas about the evils of homosexuality, so I wont' bother
		investigating them. Your stats reek of sodomites who do all they can

			"If you claim your idea of law is secular, then it is your own mind
			which is being placed on a pedestal as your god and you are being
			religious thinking you are justified by your own existence to be
			exonerated in death and exempt from the fire of Hell." At this point,
			I think we disagree about what the essence of law is. In fact, I think
			you will probably concede you overstated your case. You obviously
			think of Law as coming ultimately from whatever version of god you
			believe in. That is fine, and for some laws, it is moot whether or not
			that is accurate. For example,laws against murder, theft, dishonesty,
			and various levels of unkindness (hitting, slander/libel, harassing,
			etc.) would likely fall into that category. However, the VAST majority
			of our laws are not at all like those sorts. They are simply tools to
			help define boundaries and deal with purely practical (not
			moral/ethical) problems. There is no moral basis for what a particular
			road's speed limit is, nor is there a religious tenet that defines the
			zoning particulars that differentiate a commercial enterprise from an
			industrial one. They are just tools, with no more moral relevance than
			a hammer or a screwdriver. I think you are trying too hard to split
			hairs when you say "There is no such thing as "objective self-
			interest"". I will clarify, if you like: objective(LY OBSERVABLE)
			self-interest. What I was referring to are reasons other than
			superstition, religion, conspiracy theories, emotions, morals, and
			anything else that there is no direct physical evidence to enable
			everyone to agree on the basic facts. (e.g., when you say 'god' an
			atheist thinks 'superstition', a Christian thinks Jesus, a Hindu may
			think Vishnu, a Norse Pagan may think Odin, etc..) People from all
			these different religions, regardless of moral assumptions,
			independently can do the math and reach the conclusion that gays
			getting Social Security survivor benefits means less money in the
			system for you when you retire. That is objective(ly observable) self-
			interest. Objective observations indicate very clearly that the
			society is changing, that our problems are changing. Our population is
			330 million (double what it was in 1986), and we have external enemies
			(like ISIS) changing their tactics, and some old policies yielded
			objectively observable results that are counter to what we wanted the
			policies to accomplish. That means that new political ideas are
			required to solve the problems. We need new tools. Regarding the rest
			of what you just wrote, you are kind of ranting. Did you even read the
			article about how to avoid poverty? I let other people run their
			lives, and I run mine. I do not want anyone making my personal
			relationship decisions for me, so I extend that same courtesy to
			everyone else (assuming everyone involved is a consenting adult). I
			don't particularly care about anyone's individual choice unless: -It
			is happening on my property. -I have to pay for it. -It creates an
			involuntary obligation on anyone's part. -It impacts the physical
			space of anyone against his/her will. I don't have any business
			casting any first stones, and I certainly do not go around pretending
			I know the mind or preferences of god. Try it.

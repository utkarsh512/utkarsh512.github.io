the overthrow of capitalism and the realization of Communism.

	so·cial·ism (in Marxist theory) a transitional social state between
	the overthrow of capitalism and the realization of Communism. That
	definition is objectively wrong. Firstly, Marx used the terms
	socialism and Communism interchangeably. Secondly, the reason he did
	that is because socialism has been around since the ancient Greeks,
	and Communism was his specific contribution. You're a complete idiot,
	Outlaw. You don't know what you are talking about, you never link your
	own sources, you refuse to stay on topic when you are wrong, and
	you're a nasty, offensive little man with a big mouth and a small
	brain.

Of course the Commies support the Commie Bernie. Granma, the
Communist Party newspaper, prominently displayed a report about
Sanders and his praise of “some of the social programs implemented by
the historic leader of the Cuban Revolution Fidel Castro.” Wake up
Bernie Bro you and Crazy Bernie are both Communist.

Actually that 'mistake' is the correct way around. You see, USSR was
technically Socialist but pretended to be Communist. In reality it
completely ignored many elements of how Socialism is meant to end up
but it definitely was more Socialism than it was Communism. Communism
is anarchic in its true form, Socialism is not.

	DON'T know the difference... It's simple, really... Communism is
	POLITICS... Socialism is the ECONOMY.. excon

				Economics is used more in Socialism than Communism, yes. Guess what
				else is used more in Socialism? Politics. Communism is a community
				sharing things among them and trading goods and services for 'raw
				resource value' from each of their ability to each according to their
				need. The form of discipline and enforcement in Communism would be
				that of an indigenous tribe that's very sharing-centric in how it goes
				about handling its resources and intra-tribe relations. The 'true end
				goal' of Communism is that the entire world shares as one globalist
				land of freedom and love. Socialism is a compromise whereby monetary
				economics is still in place and a government that the people don't
				directly control is the one enforcing the policies and empowering the
				vulnerable/poor. If you would like, I can link you to longer
				explanations of the difference between them, however my wording here
				is pretty good to 'digest it' for a beginner.

						Why did USSR, China and such keep using the letter S and term
						Socialist in their names? Why not use 'Communist'?

							So, you wonder WHY they didn't call themselves what they are.. DUDE!
							You must be one of those who believe the Nazis were socialists BECAUSE

								themselves Socialists have a bad track record of mass murdering their
								own citizens. Imagine why people calling themselves Socialists garner
								my stink eye.

		Socialism : (in Marxist theory) a transitional social state between
		the overthrow of capitalism and the realization of Communism. The
		Black Socialist Jew and the Brit Troll have to be the 2 dumbest
		socialist ever born without a functional brain.

		So you DON'T know the difference... It's simple, really... Communism
		is POLITICS... Socialism is the ECONOMY.. You too, are a fucking
		idiot. Socialism is a philosophy which dates back to the Greeks, and
		Communism was Marx's specific theory of socialism. Politics and
		economy are largely interchangeable, because part of politics is the
		management of a local and/or national economy. When you don't
		understand what you are talking about, CAPITAL LETTERS AREN'T THE
		MAGIC FORM OF AUTHORITY YOU NEED. School is the magic form of
		authority you need.

You miss the larger point that Communism is a type of Socialism, but
Fox misses an even larger point than that and thinks Socialism in the
true sense has ever actually existed on earth, thus proving they can't
even identify socialism and don't know what it is. There have only
been "socialistic" policies implemented in non-socialist countries,
true fully realized socialism as a system unto itself does not exist
and never will exist because it requires total anarchy yet total
cohesion and equality.

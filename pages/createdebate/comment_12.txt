Should California give checks to illegal aliens as emergency aid?
Hello Fun: Couple things.. The state of California ISN'T issuing ANY
checks, even to American citizens.. Second, there isn't a database of
illegal aliens, so how would the state find them, even if they wanted
to give 'em aid?? excon

	You didn't answer the question: Should California give checks (money
	in any form) to illegals? I say no, but those that think so can pony
	up the dough and help them themselves.

		You didn't answer the question: Should California give checks (money
		in any form) to illegals? Hello High: I think I did.. Even IF they
		wanted to spread some cash around, there is NO database of illegals,
		so they wouldn't know where to send the checks.. Do I think they
		should be given free healthcare??? Sure.. Or is it just fine with you
		that they spread the virus around your neighborhood.. Understand, you
		don't do it for THEM.. You do it for YOUR family.. excon

''What a carve Up''/ ''Carry on Guessing''. Is it Jody, Antrim or
Dermot?

	Is it Jody, Antrim or Dermot? Or are you the exact same fascist on 3

		I note that math is not your strong point. Here's some help;- Jody,
		(1) Antrim (2) Dermot (3) Miocene (4). ''They seek him here, they seek
		him there, those left wing loonies seek him everywhere, Is he in
		heaven, is he in hell, that damned elusive Pimpernel''

			I note that math is not your strong point. I note that you don't

Nope, but they should give them bus rides to the border and send them
on their merry way. That was easy.
[Posted by HighFalutin at 2020-05-06T20:25:56+00:00 - Side: No]

	No, wrong. If you made it that easy they would all be back again
	within a week or so . The criminal dirtbags would have to be subjected
	to a degree of pain and suffering so severe that they would not wish
	to experience such horrors a second time.

No, they should be corralled onto a series of large canyons where
they could be confined with tented shelter until the end of the
Covi-19 pandemic. Supplies of food, water and medical supplies could
be airlifted in thus avoiding the necessity of having to come into
direct contact with the rabble. Shovels and quicklime along with a
range of religious paraphernalia could be provided so they could bury
their dead hygienically and with dignity. Any of these bands of
useless criminal filth who survived this necessary health precaution
should then be be deloused by dropping D.D.T., bombs on them and
afterwards herded across the border in leg and wrist shackles from
whence they came.

	Any of these bands of useless criminal filth Do you even realise that
	this is the language of Hitler?

		AND, our old friend Antrim.. His use of the word "filth" gave him
		away. excon

			AND, our old friend Antrim.. His use of the word "filth" gave him
			away. Could be Antrim. It is definitely the guy who used to post as
			Jody/Dermot. Are they the same person?
			[Posted by BurritoLunch at 2020-05-06T15:14:20+00:00 - Side: Yes]

			Actually no you're right. I think it is Antrim. Jody/Dermot was
			posting as Kilcom. Got them mixed up.
			[Posted by BurritoLunch at 2020-05-06T15:15:36+00:00 - Side: Yes]

			AND, our old friend Antrim.. I figured that was him, along with
			several other names he uses. It's the style and MO that gives him
			away.

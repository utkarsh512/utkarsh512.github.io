Uhhhh, maybe. I think he should go back to grabbin' those thingys!
Sort of "re-stimulate" his deserved reputation with womanhood. THAT
should help ALL of U.S. (Especially the evangelicals â€¦. they LOVE that
stuff! ;-) It would also, it would seem, fire up that "un-college
educated white man's spouse world" 'cause they'd get their asses
kicked if they don't vote like they're told! After ALL, THAT is "A
man's world"! The world of Trump! (God help U.S. ;-) Where can I get
one'a them "pussy hats"??? :-)

When he was elected, his approval rating overall was in the tank. He
was elected anyway. Apparently approval and electibility don't
correlate.

He could. He didn't win last time because of how much people liked
him, but because of how hated his opposition was.

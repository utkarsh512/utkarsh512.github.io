				Troll you are telling me the criminals have guns in the Utopia known

				[Posted by Chinaman at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

					the criminals have guns I'm not surprised given that merely owning a
					gun increases the likelihood of becoming a criminal. It also increases
					the likelihood of suicide and shooting someone else. I mean,
					statistics are just so counter-intuitive sometimes. Whoever would have
					guessed that owning a gun increases your chances of shooting someone?
					This common sense stuff isn't like banjo at all now, is it? I can
					completely understand why you prefer the warm blanket of rolling
					triplet arpeggios to the cold bitch of reason.

						Stupid how are the criminals getting guns to rob convenience stores
						there in the Utopia known as California ?
						[Posted by Chinaman at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

							how are the criminals getting guns The second amendment is how they
							are getting them, dopey. The piece of legislation which says you can
							walk into Walmart and buy the means to take out half a city block as
							long as you arrive before your first conviction for a felony.

								If you don't like the 2nd Amendment then do something about it you
								Little Leftist Gurl.

									If you don't like the 2nd Amendment then do something about it Lol.
									Now that's a great political system you're working with there buddy.
									If someone doesn't like your ideas then challenge them to a fight. I'm
									familiar with that one, since it is the law which governs all school
									playgrounds.

										Don't bitch about the 2nd Amendment then change you Little Pussy
										Brit.

								So criminals can pass background checks at the gun store ? Then
								stupid what good is a background check ? You are a fuckin idiot and ya
								ain't gonna last much longer here because you are just to stupid.

									So criminals can pass background checks at the gun store ? Criminals
									don't even need to go to a gun store you soppy troglodyte. There are
									plenty of roadshows etc... to purchase guns from with minimum
									background checks. Or, they can simply go to a store and (shock
									horror!!!!) lie on their application form. I mean, who would think
									that criminals might lie to obtain a weapon? Obviously there's no way
									we could have ever predicted that. Lying on your background check to
									get a gun is a federal crime. But those who do are rarely charged.

Liberals will never acknowledge the failures of their policies,
period.

The adolescent "King of the One Liners" strikes again! The Chink has
trouble putting two lines together, methinks! You'll NEVER get to be
President THAT way! You have to be able to string two TWEETS together
to qualify for President ... conservatively speaking. (By the way, I
wouldn't use that racial slur ... Chink ... on a REAL Chinaman, just a
phony Chinese outlaw. ;-)

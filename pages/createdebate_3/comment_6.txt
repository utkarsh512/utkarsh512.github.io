Great, like the final days of the Roman Empire, or the Aztecs, or the
Spanish Inquisition. Don't thinks so? Hey, nobody expects the Spanish
Inquisition!

	Your profile reflects your reputation, it will build itself as you
	create new debates, write arguments and form new relationships. Make
	it even more personal by adding your own picture and updating your
	basics.

		OK. Let's see what happens. Give it time. Hey, if two years from now
		Trump has truly saved us and I was flat wrong I'll come back in here
		and admit it. But will you?

There is no guarantee that the dream transpires, but that might come
to be. One thing to note is that in order to achieve that, Trump needs
the contribution and support of all American citizens. As
nevertheless, greatness begins from within. If Trump runs this pact on
his own with every single one of his moves being disputed, all efforts
are going to be ineffective.

I actually HOPE SO! The fact that I put it on this side shows (ahem),
my lack of faith. I worry that the "great" he makes U.S. will be
associated with the, so called, "Great Russian Bear"! The Middle East
has just started to explode, and HE has lit the fuse. (Before he is
even in office!)

I really don't believe he will - although since I've been wrong about
every single Trump prediction so far, statistically the odds are in
favor of me being again, let's hope so.

	What i really know is you live in Denmark and yes you will be wrong.

		Him living in Denmark matters how? no relivance-------------

I don't think he'll make it great but neither do I think he'll be as
badly as perceived.

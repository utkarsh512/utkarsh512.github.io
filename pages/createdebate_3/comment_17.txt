	It appears at first glance that you are basically stating that what
	made Trump bad in your mind does not make Biden bad vecause you're a
	raging hypocrite. Right?

		It appears at first glance that you are basically stating that what
		made Trump bad in your mind does not make Biden bad vecause you're a
		raging hypocrite. Right? It appears as though nothing you say has a
		hint of credibility because for the last four years you have shilled
		for a man who has lied more than any president in history, incited
		violent riots, and learned about leadership by reading literature
		written by Adolf Hitler.

			Lied more than any president: Would have to be taken a more a face
			value than one of fact, seeing as when those list come up. They are
			mostly comprised of not only indirect statements, but comments, jokes,
			and even his own opinions on matters that are not facts. You would
			also need to prove that he "incited violent riots" before stating such
			as fact. And on the note of reading books written by people like Adolf
			Hitler, you'd have to explain how something so tame can be so bad.
			Because many people read such books as part of their own class
			studies, or just to find a way at picking the mans brain. But other
			then that, the whole Trump/Nazi thing. Has gotten extremely old and
			has only become a long dead horse after these last four years.

				Lied more than any president: Would have to be taken a more a face
				value than one of fact, seeing as when those list come up. Sure.
				Granted, political fact checking is a recent phenomena. It began
				around 2008. You would also need to prove that he "incited violent
				riots" before stating such as fact. Of course this is a blatant
				logical fallacy, since you are deliberately trying to change the
				setting where this claim took place. It did not take place in a court
				of law and there is no burden of proof on me to substantiate it.
				Thankfully, I am still entitled to have my own opinion, and so Donald
				Trump has been quite unsuccessful in that regard. Proving Trump's
				guilt would be fairly easy to do if it were possible to try him like
				any ordinary citizen. Unfortunately, as you know full well, his
				culpability is decided on the basis of a vote from a senate controlled
				by members of his own party. And they still voted 57-43 in favour of
				him being guilty. Hardly encouraging numbers for anybody trying to
				make an argument that he just "accidentally" told rioters to descend
				on the Capitol and fight like hell.

					The issue here for you, is that he didn't tell rioters to do any such
					thing. More so for the fact that the phrase "fight like hell" is still
					just as politically neutral that it barely deserves mentioning. Had he
					actually told them to tear down the doors and cause some damage, then
					he'd be culpable to what transpired. But as it sit's, we know that
					there was a group of people already attempting to break into the
					capitol before his speech was even fully underway. Not to mention the
					presence of far-left agitators in the rioters ranks as well. So all
					you're doing is spreading a false narrative, that you can't actually
					support, and lamenting the fact that he was acquitted.
					[Posted by DrChamberlin at 2021-02-22T06:10:26+00:00 - Side: Trump more moral than Democrat]

				But other then that, the whole Trump/Nazi thing. Has gotten extremely
				old I am sure you think so, but the facts illustrate very clearly that
				Donald Trump has continuously copied, borrowed and paraphrased
				Hitler's rhetoric for the last four years.
				[Posted by MrClementine at 2021-02-21T09:39:01+00:00 - Side: Democrat Party is sick]

					So have multiple president throughout America's history. Even Obama's
					address for unification after the BLM riots, could be easily phrased
					over to what Hitler could be hear saying, throughout several of his
					own speeches. The fact of the matter her, is that continually trying
					to suggest that Trump is in any way relatable to Hitler. Is probably
					one of the most intellectually weak arguments that someone can make,
					today.

And why is the national guard there? Oh yeah, Trump incited a riot
that threatened to hang VP Pence, stormed the capitol building, spread
shit all over the place, killed a police officer...hmm..... Also they
are sleeping in hotels, not just Trump's hotels. I wonder what he's
charging them. Again, also: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/

	No he didn't. This is not a political issue, but a sin issue. Because
	humans are in active rebellions against Yeshua, their sin results in
	death and destruction. Read the KJV Book of Romans, and learn what I
	am saying. Now I do not auto agree with Former President Trump, but I
	don't think it's fair to infer that he is some terrorist, despot,
	basically. Like I said, I am a centrist Republican, and I voted for
	Trump, but I will happily give mad respect to a centrist or a leftist,
	or a libertaraian, if I think they do somthing to to help humans, or
	animals. That said, I do universally conderm all acts of terror,
	regardless, of belief, whether it is religious, political, or
	philisophical.

		I don't think it's fair to infer that he is some terrorist, despot,

														Saudi Arabia is a better ally because these regions you "brought

		Since when are political issues and sin issues completely separate?
		The two are not mutually exclusive in the slightest. Putting that
		aside, the National Guard was there because of that riot that happened
		because of Trumps continued lies.

		No he didn't. This is not a political issue, but a sin issue. Because
		humans are in active rebellions against Yeshua, their sin results in
		death and destruction. Dana, you literally sound like someone plucked
		you from the third century and you don't yet realise we no longer
		blame the gods for bad weather and infertility. You are sprouting
		absolute nonsense dear.

		No he didn't. This is not a political issue, but a sin issue. Because
		humans are in active rebellions against Yeshua, their sin results in
		death and destruction. This is probably a stupid question, but how do
		you rationalise this idea to yourself while at the same time you
		believe Jesus died for our sins? I thought he gave us a pass on
		sinning. Also, I think it is quite unfair that we get blamed for being
		sinners if God created us that way. That's a bit like building a bike
		without wheels and then cursing it when it won't work.

			God did not create us sinners, or create sin, He gave us free will,
			and we chose to to sin, in the Book of Genesis.

				God did not create us sinners, or create sin That's a complete lie
				dear. He created man in his own image, so if man is a sinner then so
				is God. He gave us free will No he didn't. Free will is an illusion
				brought about through the way we experience time. You can't produce
				any evidence that free will exists just like you can't produce any
				evidence God exists, or produce any evidence to support anything you
				ever say. In short, you've gone crazy and you are trying to persuade
				all the other people you meet to be crazy too.

Unfortunately, after what we've seen with the democrats doing their
best to cram these men and women into such intolerable conditions.
Because the last I was able to see, was that they were limited to
sleeping in parking decks. While only having very bare necessities at
their disposal. It sure does appear that way, at the very least. That
Trump is attempting to do his best by way of these people. Who're
being forced into such conditions by the democrats at this point.

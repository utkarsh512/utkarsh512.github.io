	Grandpaw can you explain why your god like figure Obama got the Nobel
	Peace Prize when his legacy is just the opposite ? Before he took
	office in 2008, Barack Obama vowed to end America’s grueling conflicts
	in Iraq and Afghanistan. During his second term, he pledged to take
	the country off what he called a permanent war footing. “Our
	systematic effort to dismantle terrorist organizations must continue,”
	he said in May 2013. “But this war, like all wars, must end. That’s
	what history advises. It’s what our democracy demands.” But Obama
	leaves a very different legacy as he prepares to hand his commander-
	in-chief responsibilities to Donald Trump. U.S. military forces have
	been at war for all eight years of Obama’s tenure, the first two-term
	president with that distinction. He launched airstrikes or military
	raids in at least seven countries: Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya,
	Yemen, Somalia and Pakistan. http://www.latimes.com/projects/ la-na-
	pol-obama-at-war/ Come on Grandpaw tell me about your God like figure
	Obie !

	Grandpaw thought you Demorats hated the wealthy ? Barack Obama's net
	worth is estimated to be $40 million. Aside from the six-figure
	pension he receives as a former president, Obama has made millions
	from speaking engagements and his best-selling books.Aug 4, 2018 What
	you got say about your God Grandpaw?????????

		Well, just because most of the world didn't want to hear Dubya's
		speeches, and Reagan was a bit "out of it" when HE left office,
		doesn't mean Obama should be afraid of making money off his
		popularity. People LOVE to hear from honest, intelligent, caring
		people who can talk intelligently and have solutions to problems.
		Making money is a capitalistic thing! If you got it to sell … sell it!
		I guarantee NO ONE will want to buy what Trump has to sell when he
		leaves …. if he has anything LEFT! C'MON! You, as a conservative., are
		against someone making money??? His popularity speaks for itself …. in
		$$$$$$! It's a shame you have no one as popular. ;-(

	been ? I mean waking up every 5 days from a wine induced stupor and
	then trying to govern ! Was Hillary your next God like figure

		Pray tell when you saw Hillary drunk …. and NO politician has been a
		god like figure to ME … even YOUR GOD! You just can't seem to get
		anything RIGHT these days! Have they legalized Pot in your state???

				He may not have helped much, not like Putin did anyway, or the lies
				that the weak minded and blind couldn't see. You had 20/20 vision on
				those! In one ear, float around in the empty space, and fall into
				place! ;-) Got something against "Grandpaws"??? I hope you don't get
				to be one. Grandpaws are supposed to be "nice"! You STILL didn't say
				where you saw Hillary drunk!???

Do you want your president to be BETTER than you, or just LIKE you?
1)None of the above. Keep the economy rolling baby. He's not a Sunday
School teacher. 2)Did you want Bill Clinton and Obama to be better
than you, or chasing interns and throwing gangsta rap parties with
kids around in the Whitehouse?

	Did you want Bill Clinton and Obama to be better than you, or chasing
	interns and throwing gangsta rap parties with kids around in the
	Whitehouse Hello again BS: What's better? Chasing interns around or
	having a party? DUDE!! A party sounds MUCH nicer.. Besides, when I was
	a kid, blue haired, pinched nosed adults didn't like Rock and Roll
	either, and have you SEEN the way Elvis shakes his hips?? Are you one
	of those??? excon

		What's better? Chasing interns around or having a party? DUDE!! A
		party sounds MUCH nicer.. A party where the N word was thrown around
		like confetti, and around kids.

		SUPER STUPID can you tell me how many women came forward with sexual
		abuse allegations against the Demorat Bill Clinton ? Come on SUPER
		STUPID and step up just once !

		Hillary Clinton became the nation's first lady in 1992. In 2000, she
		won her own election as a U.S. senator from New York, and she served
		as President Barack Obama's secretary of state from 2009 through 2013.
		Hillary Clinton's net worth stood at $45 million as of October 2017,
		according to Forbes.Oct 26, 2017 SUPER STUPID Demorats despise the
		rich yet Hillary is your Goddess ?

		Besides, when I was a kid, blue haired, pinched nosed adults didn't
		like Rock and Roll either, and have you SEEN the way Elvis shakes his
		hips?? Are you one of those??? No. We aren't chasing Stormy Daniels
		and Karen McDougal around as the morality police. That would be the
		Democrats.

		Says a hypocrite who would hoard money in a New York minute if he was
		smart enough to know how to make any.

			I work 25 hours a week and make more than the average salary. Why
			would I want to work more hours? What statistic do you have to suggest
			earning huge amounts makes you happy? Honestly mate... Learn from
			other countries. The things that make people happy are being able to
			spend time with their family (I.e. having paid vacations and paternity
			leave etc) and not having to work 3 jobs.

Yes, but in fairness the extremists from both ends of the political
spectrum do that when they don't like Constitutional protections. When
the Left wants to censor free speech by the right they're doing it
too.

I could go death Con 9 and talk about the Constitutionality of
roundups when national security is at risk, but it would whiz right
across heads and out the window and instantly into labeling and
accusing, despite me simply stating facts. So let's go there shall we?
Leftist Political correctness is an attempt to violate the First
Amendment. Shutting down Conservative speeches with violence is an
attack on the First Amendment. Leftist Overzealous gun laws and/or
attempts to take guns away are an attack on the 2nd Amendment.
Leftists not protecting our country from threats abroad is a violation
of the 10th Amendment.

	Hello bront: DUDE!!! Wrong on ALL points.. It's DEFCON, not death con
	The First Amendment protects us from GOVERNMENT - NOT leftists. Same
	thing with your speeches. Nahhh... IF leftists wanted to TAKE your
	guns away, I'd agree that it's an attack on the 2nd Amendment.. But,
	they DON'T.. They simply DON'T... I NEVER took an Oath of
	Citizenship.. Does that mean I'm NOT a citizen??? I DO notice, though,
	that you don't DENY that you wanna SHITCAN the Constitution, and that
	was the POINT of this debate. DUDE! excon

		Conservatives. The left is.

		FRAUD you are really stupid ! Congress shall make no law respecting
		an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise
		thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the
		right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the
		Government for a redress of grievances. 1st Amendment protects
		religion , the press and the right to PEACEABLY assemble and to
		petition the Government and that is all ! Come on FRAUD tell me all
		about how the 1st Amendment protects us all from Government overreach
		and Government taxation ! Do you see it quoted in the 1st Amendment ?

I find it ironic that the example used of "roundups" was ordered by
none other than a Democrat.

FDR rounded up 120,000 Japanese into camps, 62% of which were
American citizens. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Internment of
Japanese_Americans

	Hello bront: DUDE AGAIN!!!!! So, since a left wing president did it,
	it's ok if Trump does it??? DUDE!!!! excon

		1)The fact it was a left winger means that calling it "right wing
		thinking" is bs. 2)Round ups are done out of desperation when a group
		has become a threat to the very people that welcomed them in. Is it
		nice? No. But nice is getting us bombed, knifed, raped, burned alive
		and killed. At some point you have to realize you are in a fight and
		fight back. You don't just keep bringing them in hoping "these are all
		good ones". That is insanity and unforgivably stupid.

And finally, the Islamic attacks on the West have reached to the
point of being an act of war, and it should be treated as such. And I
don't want to hear about the Jews. The Jews were not bombing,
threatening and killing the Germans, nor were they commanded to kill
Germans by name in the Torah. Muslims are commanded to kill 3 groups
by name: Jews, Christians, Unbelievers. So they are literally
"commanded by Allah" to destroy the West and kill Westerners. We gave
them their shot. We were nice about it. We welcomed them into our
countries, and? It's not worked out. They come in and kill us. We have
the right to stop dangerous infiltrated groups from entering into our
family and children's space.

	Hello again, bront: DUDE!!! Well, if THAT'S the reason you wanna
	SHITCAN the Constitution, who could complain??? Well, I'll tell you
	WHO could complain?? ME!!! A Constitution loving patriot like ME!! A
	man who DEFENDED the Constitution with his LIFE, like ME.. A man who
	SWORE an oath to the Constitution, like ME.. That's who.. excon

		Just because you don't like it, that doesn't make it
		unconstitutional. Its "Constitutionality" was held up by the Supreme
		Court. And just because you wish Islam wasn't dangerous, that doesn't
		magically mean it isn't. We were nice. We let them in. We tried. It
		didn't work out. Let the West heal and have a break from its people
		being slaughtered in the streets.

	Hello again, bront: I got it.. You're FINE with DESTROYING the
	Constitution.. I got it.. So, here's the DEAL.. Whenever I hear a
	rightwinger, like YOU, SNIVEL about left wingers who don't respect the
	Constitution, I'm gonna REMIND you of your hypocrisy... Did you take
	this aforementioned citizenship oath?? Did you take an oath when you
	joined the military??? Did it say, I'll obey it until I decide I don't
	like it??? I don't think it did.. I took an oath, and I don't remember
	those words.. Do you even UNDERSTAND what an oath is??? Naah, you
	don't... It's a promise WITHOUT an escape clause.. You don't know what
	that means, do you??? You either LOVE this country or you HATE it..
	There is NO middle ground. From MY perspective, anybody who'd THROW
	the Constitution away, HATES it here... excon

		Fact: saying it is doesn't make it true. Fact: me stating that it is
		constitutional doesn't mean I like the idea or think it's neccessary,
		at least not yet.

		soldiers do again? Protect our people from foreign enemies and protect

		just yesterday..

Quit saying it's unconstitutional when it isn't. Do I want to round
people up? No. But if we keep having acts of war manifested on us and
it becomes them or my family, I can justify roundups real quick like.

FDR FRAUD ?

Please explain how our constitution protected the Nazi soldiers who
gassed Jews or the filthy slave owners who raped and hung blacks? If
citizens who become felons can not vote and forfeit their 5th
Amendment rights, then what makes you think that illegals who are not
citizens have any rights. Except as war criminal invaders and spies.
[Posted by JustTruth at 2017-06-10T17:09:36+00:00 - Side: They LOVE the Constitution]

	Hello again, UNTRUTH: Dude! The Constitution DIDN'T protect Nazi's..
	Don't know where you learned that.. SOME felons can't vote, but MOST
	of 'em can, and they DON'T lose their 5th Amendment rights... PERIOD!
	This debate is about rounding up American citizens - not illegals. No
	truths outta 5 is exceptionally bad.. Dude! excon

		FRAUD you are saying the Leftist want to round up citizens just like
		FDR did ? FDR was a Democrat is that what the Progressives want as of
		today ?
		[Posted by outlaw60 at 2017-06-10T19:06:42+00:00 - Side: Yes they are]

		You are really spun out today FRAUD if you can make the connection
		between Nazi's and the 5th Amendment then give me your convoluted
		answer !

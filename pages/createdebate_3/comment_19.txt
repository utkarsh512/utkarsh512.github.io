The FBI says none of it happened. If the libs are lying on this,
makes you wonder what other lies they are telling.

Confront? Why? You mean Congratulate? Well, why not? If we're getting
close to half way through the first term and you muppets still can't
get anything to stick, Trump and Putin should give each other a pat on
the back for a job well done and look to the horizon. So are you
incompetent? Or wrong?

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said the indictment does not
name any American citizen, but told reporters that defendants
"corresponded with several Americans during the course of the
conspiracy through the internet." "There is no allegation in this
indictment that any American citizen committed a crime," Rosenstein
said at a news conference. "There is no allegation that the conspiracy
altered the vote count or changed any election result." Deputy White
House press secretary Lindsay Walters referenced Rosenstein's comments
and said there is no evidence tying the Trump campaign to hacking
attempts. "Today's charges include no allegations of knowing
involvement by anyone on the campaign and no allegations that the
alleged hacking affected the election result," Walters said in a
statement. "This is consistent with what we have been saying all
along." Trump private attorney Rudy Giuliani in a tweet said the
indictments are "good news for all Americans" but called on the
special counsel investigation to end. "The Russians are nailed. No
Americans are involved. Time for Mueller to end this pursuit of the
President and say President Trump is completely innocent," he tweeted.

He'll say: "Let's practice the Art of the Deal here." "What can I
give YOU to forget about "that stuff" you have on me." I'll give you
ANYTHING! Syria? Kosovo?, Georgia?, how about MY country????????? How
about Milania?????????????? THERE WILL BE NO WITNESSES! Our country is
in incompetent hands! VLAD WINS! HE is competent … and vicious!

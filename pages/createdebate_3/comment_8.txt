I'm simply confused as to why gays get preferential treatment over
any other sexual minority. Why aren't we fighting for the rights of
polygamists, zoophiles, incest practitioners, necrophiles etc?

	This is a good question. While I'm in favor of gay marriage, I do
	find myself wondering where we should draw the line. I'm leaning
	towards the opinion that marriage isn't needed at all.

It's their life and it doesn't impact me. Thus live and let live. If
it's a sin against God (which I believe it is), that's something God
can deal with. But I don't have the power, and nor should I, to
dictate what other people can and can't do in the privacy of their own
homes. Besides, I'm an kinky as all hell myself.

	I'm one of the few Christians who supports gay rights and thank you
	for your opinion :).

	I also hold this opinion. My job as a Christian is to be an
	instrument of gods message not his wrath. I don't support or oppose
	gay rights. I maintain that a marriage between 2 members of the same
	sex isn't a marriage but they can call it what they wish. Other than
	that I don't care.

I support gay rights even if I disagree with some of their choices.
No, I am not saying that homosexuality is a choice.

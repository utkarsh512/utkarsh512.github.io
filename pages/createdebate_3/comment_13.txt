It should be. Pro-choice means your choice, whatever you decide. That
was easy and you're welcome.

Pro-choice is a Constitutional right. Constitutional rights should be
used, not abused. Protect the Constitution at all costs, while doing
what is necessary for a "more perfect union".

	Well said, there are many who like to cherry pick the constitution
	and only acknowledge the parts they agree with.

		I have no problem with that, because people have the right, to think
		whatever they wish, no questions asked.

	I am prochoice, but wondering, where abortion is mentioned, in the
	Constitution?

		Where in the Constitution is the right to marry, have children, use
		contraception, the right to self-defense, etc. mentioned? They aren't
		mentioned by name, but fall under the concept of Liberty. e.g. from
		the 14th Amendment Section 1: "... No State shall make or enforce any
		law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of
		the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life,
		liberty, or property, without due process of law;..." from the 9th
		Amendment: "The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights,
		shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the
		people."

			i don't have to answer your question, because my rights come from
			god, not government, and you don't have the right, to tell me, what to
			do. You need to troll, elsewhere.

				Whether you think your rights come from God or not - your question
				was where is the right in the Constitution. My question was a
				rhetorical one - which I answered with my next statement.

		It isn't, but, Roe v Wade was found to be "Constitutional Right" by
		the SCOTUS.

			I don't care, i am asking, about the constitution, not the SCOTUS.

			Killing human beings is what you Socialist like so why you so upset
			about the Corona you fuckin Confused Socialist.

				I am not a socialist, i am a minarchist, so get it right. Forcing
				women, to give birth, is way too much, government.

					I sure didn't call you a Socialist but you must have had a bad dream
					along the way.

						Thank you for sharing your thoughts. We should chat, sometime, yeah?

							Here is the problem. People take a long trip on a short plank daily.
							So when you accuse someone of something that is not true then the fore
							mentioned statement is true.
							[Posted by Chinaman at 2020-04-07T03:54:51+00:00 - Side: Yes.]

							Your words : I am not a socialist, i am a minarchist, so get it
							right. Forcing women, to give birth, is way too much, government.
							Everything in the above statement you typed was wrong and has nothing
							to do with what i said. You internet babies carry your emotions on
							your shoulder and you don't have the brain power to put a sentence
							together without your emotions getting in your way.

No. Pro-choice just means that people don't think the government
should make the decision for all women and all circumstances. Many
people who would not get an abortion themselves still believe it is
wrong for the government to legislate it.

	I agree. Do you think it is a strawman, for someone to call
	prochoicers, proaborts, because they are prochoice?
	[Posted by YIsRisenLord at 2020-04-06T04:22:44+00:00 - Side: No.]

		Yes. I think pro-choice vs pro-life is a false dichotomy and that
		pro-choice is often labeled as pro-abortion in an attempt to smear its
		supporters.

			I agree. I believe fetuses are people, but so are pregnant mothers.
			Shitty situations, can require shitty choices.

Typically pro-choice policies (education, subsidized contraception,
etc.) reduce abortions more than so called anti-abortion policies
(Global Gag Rule, defunding Planned Parenthood, cutting Title X
contraceptive funding, etc.) https://www.scielosp.org/article/bwho/

Pro-choice means exactly what it says. The mother-to-be has the
choice of continuing with the pregnancy and giving birth or having an
abortion within the parameters of the law.
[Posted by Kilcom at 2020-04-06T10:39:24+00:00 - Side: No.]

	I agree. i would rather die, than be pregnant,, so i support the
	mother, over the fetus.

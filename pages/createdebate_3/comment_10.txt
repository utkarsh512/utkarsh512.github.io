Should we have a quota for women in bricklaying or for men in
nursing? To expect equality of outcome in any field is to lack an
understanding of the biological differences between men and women.
While many differences exist, one that is particularly important to
job choice is the fact that, in general, males are more thing-oriented
and women are more person-oriented (1). Further, this difference is
biological, not social, in nature (2). To deal with women in
parliament specifically, a feminist study suggests only 40% of women
want senior leadership positions, opposed to 56% of men (3). Further,
studies suggest that women value power less than men do and have lower
level ideal positions (4). Men are also more likely to apply for
positions they felt were above their qualifications and ability than
females (5). It should be easy to see how this ties into holding
political office: after all, running the country is no doubt something
nobody is fully qualified for. Since confidence is linked to
testosterone levels (6) this means that there are several concrete
biological reasons that more men are in parliament than women.

There should be no quota's for anything. It should ALWAYS be about
the qualifications of the person applying for the job. The best person
should be hired regardless whether they are a man or woman. Ask
yourself why the Left must always wallow in identity politics. It's
always about pandering to their special interest groups for votes to
them!

No. In any job, it should be based on qualifications, not gender or
color.

I guess that's up to you and yours. I'm beginning to think WE should
have a quota on MEN in GOVERNMENT …. they don't seem to have enough
BALLS to fight against a PERVERT! Women have been doing that for years
without enough help FROM those government "men". Perhaps we need MORE
WOMEN to wage a war on the perverts …. and the Pervert-in-Chief …
before U.S. men get into too much "comrad-ery"!

	Hypocrite, you lack the balls to fight against No Restriction
	abortions! HYPOCRITE! You worry about any possible sin from Trump's
	past while ignoring your Democrat Party's support for killing viable
	babies for any reason! HYPOCRITE! Your priorities are absolutely
	screwed up!

		Hypocrite, you lack the balls to fight against No Restriction
		abortions! HYPOCRITE! Balls is a bad word when used in such a way, you
		need to repent of your bad words. You worry about any possible sin
		from Trump's past while ignoring your Democrat Party's support for
		killing viable babies for any reason! But you are ignoring the
		republican party's support for blowing up whole countries for any
		reason. HYPOCRITE! Your priorities are absolutely screwed up! But you
		only care about abortion and licking the bible like some kind of dildo
		meanwhile the right wing makes it so that millions of people will be
		in poverty and it blows up 3rd world countries and rapes women and
		babies and wants to legalize child rape.

			LOL, what a fool! Thanks for making it to my ban list before getting

			create.

		It's not that I "don't have the balls", it's that I'm NOT totally
		against abortion like YOU are. I'm NOT FOR "No restrictions abortion",
		I'm FOR "doctor and patient agreed upon" abortion! (NOT a "religiously
		agreed upon" restriction)! I'm FOR any abortion a woman has REASON to
		not carry the fetus. I'm NOT "FOR" abortion just to escape the
		"inconvenience", but, I am for the woman's right to CHOOSE for
		whatever reason! I'm NOT FOR ANYONE'S religion taking away a woman's
		RIGHTS! My "priorities" are MY rights, they are NOT YOURS to dictate,
		nor are a woman's! YOUR priorities are dictated by your hypocritical,
		ancient belief and have SCREWED YOU UP!

			I'm FOR "doctor and patient agreed upon" abortion! So the IDIOT has
			some ties to RALPH NORTHAM ??????????????????

			ROFLOL, TALK ABOUT DOUBLE SPEAK! You just spewed the most mindless
			garbage I have ever heard in my life. You said, as all phony hypocrite
			Democrats say, that you are not for No Restriction abortions. Then in
			your next breath say you are for any abortion a doctor and patient
			agrees up on! Democrats support No Restriction abortions between
			patient and doctor you deceptive joke. All the patient has to say is
			that she is depressed and the doctor can legally allow the abortion!
			Then you said you are not for convenience abortions, but rather you
			are for a woman's right to choose FOR ANY REASON! You need some help
			with Dementia or something because your brain seems to be losing it.
			What you just spewed is the exact same lunacy every other Democrat
			spews about abortions so I guess you are all suffering from some sort
			of dysfunction. I think it's something like the self love syndrome.
			Gee, what a shock. IGNORE!

				Let me explain reality to you. I said I am NOT PERSONNALLY FOR no
				restriction abortions. That doesn't mean I'm AGAINST another's rights.
				Allowing others to use their rights, even if one disagrees with them,
				is democracy, not hypocrisy. You are saying even IF the woman IS
				depressed a doctor should not allow an abortion. Thousands of
				depressed women commit suicide each year, and, if they are pregnant,
				take their viable one with them. One plus one equals two. I guess that
				would make you happy?? Yes, a doctor, in most states, CAN legally
				allow an abortion. I'm VERY glad you are NOT a doctor, and apparently
				from your amateurish and politically incorrect (and twisted), mental
				diagnosis, you are not even close to a psychiatrist either. Anyone who
				spends hours each day fixated on one subject, ranting about the same
				thing over and over, has a "viable" mental problem. Maybe even an
				ACTUAL one. You look kind of "mental" rolling on the floor laughing
				out loud, I'm sure. I suggest you put a mirror down close to the floor
				and look at it, see what dementia REALLY looks like! (Look around,
				first, make sure outlaw isn't down there with you ;-).

					FOOL! You're ramblings are not even worth my time. Thanks for finally
					admitting you support No Restriction abortions. Most of the rest of
					the phony Liberals on this site deny supporting it. I wonder if
					racists once said that they are personally against having slaves, but
					support the right of others to own them. Can your mind grasp the
					inhumanity of what you support?

					AL you do not live in a CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC

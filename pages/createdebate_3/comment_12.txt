Is Bernie purposely self-destructing? No thinking human being could
believe for a moment this is a rational idea. Every day lately is like
a contest to see which SOCIALIST candidate can promise the most free
money. But IDIOT BARNEY wants other people's money to pay for his FREE
FOR ALL agenda ! What a sight to see as the SOCIALIST get all TWISTED
UNDER THEIR AXLE !!!!!!!!

Hyperbole and free shit for the downtrodden are the only tools
Democrats have. Identify a problem government can fix then target the
villains that caused it and raise taxes that reduce wealth and the
shrink the economy. Wash, rinse, repeat. Harvard is a human right and
seen as being a free right so long as it is paid for by someone else.

	free shit for the downtrodden are the only tools Democrats have. Shut

	three days ago literally linking us to Nazi propaganda and today
	you've been linking fake news stories from the Daily Caller. Shut your
	toxic lying mouth you waste of fucking air.

		It's not even election year yet and so far the SOCIALIST have
		promised: Free college Student loan forgiveness Reparations for NEGROS
		Reparations for GAYS Free healthcare for the entire world Yet they
		offer no idea about how they will pay for any of this. How can anyone
		with more than 2 brain cells take these people seriously?

							THEY SAVED MONEY (is that few/small enough words for you?) since
							you're obviously not going to read the references: "Across all the
							services examined, the associated costs for public services consumed
							in the year after receipt of supportive housing declined by close to
							60 percent ." "81 percent of those who participated in the study
							remained in permanent housing after two years." "tenants visited
							emergency rooms 648 fewer times (81 percent reduction) and were in the
							hospital 292 fewer days (62 percent reduction) than the two years
							prior. This led to a $2.4 million decrease in total billing, a drop of
							nearly 70 percent ."

								Nice rant but what is the end cost to taxpayers ?????? Seems that is
								a struggle for ya !
								[Posted by outlaw60 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

									How does saving money equal cost to you? If they are currently
									spending $40,000 per homeless person in services and they cut that to
									$20,000, the taxpayer would save 50% “On average, these individuals
									were costing the county $40,000 or more per year to be on the streets.
									We can house each one for $15,000 a year”
									http://www.fox4news.com/news/dallas-sees-success-with-tiny-homes-for-
									homeless It’s now years later. And these days, Walker says the state
									saves $8,000 per homeless person in annual expenses. “We’ve saved
									millions on this” https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/ inspired-
									life/wp/2015/04/17/ the-surprisingly-simple-way-utah-solved- chronic-

								Can you explain why the HOMELESS rate is so high in CALIFORNIA
								?????????????????

						Is CALI just gonna GIVEAWAY homes at no cost to anyone ????????? Are
						you as STUPID as you claim to be ???????????

								There is such a thang as a FREE LUNCH ????? Well who pays for the
								FREE LUNCH you got an answer ??????????????????
								[Posted by outlaw60 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

									There are such things as good investments. If you can get improved
									economic productivity, stability, and activity, reduced congestion and
									air pollution, better quality of life, reduced crime, better land use
									through fewer parking garages, higher property values, etc. for a cost
									less than that of the increase property values, then you have a win-
									win (-win-win...).

		Taxing Wall Street to pay for indoctrinating students into Marxism is
		a good plan ???????

		Shut up Bronto Number 9,876,568,765 probably wasn’t a waste of your
		time. I bet he listens this time.

			Number 9,876,568,765 probably wasn’t a waste of your time. Inventing
			absurd assertions involving 10 digit numbers probably won't do much to
			convince people I'm wrong about you being a lying Nazi.

				I don’t need to convince people. No one buys your bullshit anyway,
				except maybe one or two pea brains. My point is that your broken
				record plea to “shut up” is nothing more than an amusing waste of your
				time.

So for all the responsible students who actually paid their debt,
what message would this send to them? The message is to run up debt
that can never be paid back ( kind of like credit cards), and then
simply refuse to pay it back until some radical Democrat forces others
to bail you out once again. We see it every day on commercials where
they say they can reduce your income tax debt where you only have to
pay back a fraction. It's the ole No Fault Democrat ideology. Pander
to the irresponsible low end voters by stealing taxes from hard
working responsible Americans. Taxation without representation.

	Now this is very good !!!!!!!!!!!! Lets see how many professors are
	signing up to TEACH FOR FREE? If all these Socialists want FREE then
	start with the PROFESSORS donating their paycheck to FREE education
	but i don't see ANY hands up for that nor have i heard the Socialist
	Barney mention that

	With someone like Sanders, education for profit wouldn't be a thing.
	Ergo, no student debt in the first place. Education and medicine don't
	mix with profit. This is clear. For many decades the UK didn't require
	its students (many of whom occupy Conservative government posts) to
	pay anything from their own pocket for their education. Now, finance
	is an impediment to education. When finance is an impediment to
	education, class dictates opportunity. When class dictates
	opportunity, class mobility stagnates. When class mobility stagnates,
	economies stagnate.

		When corrupt politicians control our education and health, it's
		stagnates FREEDOM!

			What a 'Murican thing to say. Beer, barbeque, Jesus and freedom.
			Oorah! Also a very dimwitted response. There's far less "freedom" in
			having to pay 100k for a heart bypass that ends up bankrupting you,
			than getting treated for less than 5k with a system that spends less
			than a third per capita than the US spends for medicaid and medicare.
			You think you have it good, but in this arena you most certainly do
			not.

That's the standard loony leftist's ideology. We'll give away tax
payer's hard earned money to further our electoral appeal to the
nation's irresponsible spongers. It's so easy to be magnanimous with
other people's money in what is transparently a cheap attempt to
unfairly alleviate the more affluent members of our society from the
dept they incurred by knowingly entering into a legally binding
contract. Anyone whose earnings has reached or exceeded the
contractually agreed level as stated in the conditions of the contract
but willfully evades to comply with these terms is committing a
criminal offence. In reality this blustering, virtue signalling
progressive is proposing to pardon criminal fraudsters. Man, man oh
man.

Progressive announces "Plan to Forgive All Student Debt" Hello poochy
boy: This is easy IF you understand the concept of INVESTMENT.. Most
people think investment = expense.. Of course, if an investment
doesn't pay off, it IS an expense.. I say the country WINS when we
have an educated populace. Being an uneducated person yourself, you
wouldn't agree.. Now, fetch this stick.. excon

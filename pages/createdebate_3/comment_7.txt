Nope. About 40% (probably more but it's difficult for exact
percentages) of the immigrants that come here do so by flying and then
they overstay their visa's. There will always be breaks in the wall,
tunnels have already been built, there will always be a way around.
The money wasted on both building and maintaining this wall would be
better spent helping our homeless, feeding children and supporting
veterans.

	How Mexico Treats Illegal Aliens The Mexican government will bar
	foreigners if they upset “the equilibrium of the national
	demographics.” How’s that for racial and ethnic profiling? If
	outsiders do not enhance the country’s “economic or national
	interests” or are “not found to be physically or mentally healthy,”
	they are not welcome. Illegal entry into the country is equivalent to
	a felony punishable by two years’ imprisonment. Law-enforcement
	officials at all levels — by national mandate — must cooperate to
	enforce immigration laws, including illegal-alien arrests and
	deportations. Ready to show your papers? Mexico’s National Catalog of

No. It's a colossal waste of money. People can still use ladders,
grappling hooks, and underground tunnels to get across. They can still
send drugs over via all those same methods, plus catapults and drones.
The only way to stop people crossing the border is constant monitoring
of every inch of the border, which would cost a fortune. That cost
would need to be weighed against the cost of having illegal immigrants
here.

The wall is only all waffle the building of the wall will never get
past planning stage , there are an array of land owners ,
environmentalists and legislators Trump will have to go through first
; he is playing Joe public like a well seasoned salesman and will get
full credit for a valiant effort ........

Insofar that the security wall will frustrate the criminal's efforts
of entering the United States I am certain that it's erection will
make a significant contribution to significantly reducing the,
virtually, uncontrolled influx of Mexican criminals. It is unfortunate
that the Mexicans have made such a mess of their country and even more
unfortunate that the Mexican government cannot control its own
borders. It is in this context that it is only but fair and proper
that the Mexican taxpayers, and not the U.S, pay for the construction
of the wall. The word illegal means, contrary to, or forbidden by law,
so every Mexican who willfully enters the U.S, illegally is, by
definition, a criminal. Due to the illegal status of the Mexican
illegals their employers cannot deduct the just and lawful taxes from
the earnings of the greaser criminals and their presence in the labor
market keeps wages unrealistically low and denies the indigenous
workers a 'livable wage'. Those illegals/criminals who run businesses
here profit from the stable and comparatively lucrative market which
the U.S, provides, once more without paying their taxes in the same
way as everyone has to. Any measure which helps in keeping the filth
out, and retarding the eventual outcome of turning parts of America
into a third world country similar to Mexico must be good.

Trump justifies the wall with the idea that it'll stop drug
smugglers. However, he completely underestimates them; they're not
stupid enough to just walk over the border or climb over the fence
with a huge pile of drugs, they go through tunnels and by air. The
wall is a huge waste of resources which Trump should instead spend on
healthcare and your failing education system.

		Your comment is irrelevant and has nothing to do with my argument.

	Now NICK how could a failing education system have happened under
	Barack Obama ? Was he not the POTUS for the last 8 years ? How did
	this happen ?
	[Posted by outlaw60 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

		Your education system has been failing for decades. I love this ping-
		pong argument which Trumpsters constantly use. "Yeah, but, Obama did
		this and this!" Blaming Obama for things when I'm trying to make a
		suggestion as to how Trump can better spend his budget is ridiculously
		ignorant. You can't ignore criticisms of Trump for his entire
		presidency by deflecting them onto other people.

	Tell me NICK how well the NHS is working in England ! You got some
	facts for me ?
	[Posted by outlaw60 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

		Well, we have an utterly incompetent health secretary (who happens to
		be a conservative, would you believe that!) who wants to cut pay for
		doctors whilst increasing their working hours. The NHS needs more
		funding, and it's the conservatives who are preventing that. Other
		than that, it's working absolutely fine. Universal, free healthcare
		for everyone in the country with minimal strain on taxes. What the US
		should be, basically.

Yep. Walls kept out the Mongolian hoards and Hezbollah out of Israel.
The Berlin Wall worked too well, which is why it "had to be
destroyed".
[Posted by brontoraptor at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

Yes, the wall will work. The big question is how will he actually
build it and pay for it?
[Posted by Love2debate at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

I think it would work a little bit but I think the main message
behind it is "hey we're not going to put up with this anymore." It may
stop some of the illegal immigration but most of them come through the
air or water ways anyways. I think we need to strengthen the border
patrols without building the wall. That would be a lot more effective
[Posted by MistVillage at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

First of all, it's not Trump's wall. The wall would belong to half of
America that voted him into office. Second, our border security HAS
NOT worked for decades and is the reason we need a wall. If you listen
to the liberal media, you willl be fed constant deception. Look beyond
the biased news networks. Watch Fox news if you want to get both sides
of the information.

YES! It will be a YUGE memorial after his death. He will always be
remembered for taking tax money away from schools and hospitals, roads
and railways, the poor and sick to build something that, remnants of
which will exist on the lands of conservatives for centuries! (Others
will eventually tear theirs down to make their land useful again). We
will all remember, in our history books, when we were trumped!

Now I don't know if this is true, but a wall isn't going to do
anything.

It worked in Germany, it's working now in Israel, and it kept the
Mongols out of China.

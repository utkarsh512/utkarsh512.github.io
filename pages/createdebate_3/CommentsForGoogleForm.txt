Obama policies I hate but not the person.##$$##@@https://utkarsh512.github.io/pages/createdebate_3/comment_2.txt@#@#@I guess so. I personally have mixed feelings about Vietnam. The plan was poorly executed. But I also believe that communism was bad. I know that we never could have won that war and Nixon new that too and that's why he started Vietnamization. We could still effectively kill the enemy while leaving the country. We could also debate the food/farming industry.##$$##@@https://utkarsh512.github.io/pages/createdebate_3/comment_3.txt@#@#@This got a down vote.

DNA Ancestry Tests Are 'Meaningless'. A group of scientists now offers a public warning that these ancestry tests have little scientific backing, and are so unreliable and inaccurate that they amount to "genetic astrology." https://www.medicaldaily.com/ dna-ancestry-tests-are- meaningless-your- historical-genealogy-search-244586 Adam Rutherford's amazing book A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived is on shelves in the USA now; debunking the absurd claims made by genetics testing companies -- claims about your distant relationship to ancient kings or the percentage of your genes that came from Vikings. Rutherford's quest to debunk the highly profitable "genetic astrology" industry has some staunch allies, including the wonderful Sense About Science people (previously), including Steve Jones, Emeritus Professor of Human Genetics at UCL and Prof Mark Thomas. https://boingboing.net/2018/09/25/ you-are-not-a-viking.html Our guide explains why DNA tests are used in population research and why they do not provide accurate information about an individualâ€™s ancestry https://archive.senseaboutscience.org/ pages/genetic-ancestry- testing.html You're a fucking idiot mate.##$$##@@https://utkarsh512.github.io/pages/createdebate_3/comment_9.txt@#@#@ROFLOL, TALK ABOUT DOUBLE SPEAK! You just spewed the most mindless garbage I have ever heard in my life. You said, as all phony hypocrite Democrats say, that you are not for No Restriction abortions. Then in your next breath say you are for any abortion a doctor and patient agrees up on! Democrats support No Restriction abortions between patient and doctor you deceptive joke. All the patient has to say is that she is depressed and the doctor can legally allow the abortion! Then you said you are not for convenience abortions, but rather you are for a woman's right to choose FOR ANY REASON! You need some help with Dementia or something because your brain seems to be losing it. What you just spewed is the exact same lunacy every other Democrat spews about abortions so I guess you are all suffering from some sort of dysfunction.

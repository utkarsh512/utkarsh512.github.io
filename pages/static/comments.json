                " you drop the sophistry (whether my error was obvious or not in the\ncontext of what i said) and the word games (definition of facetious)\nand i will try to tone down my combative writing style. i have no\nproblem apologizing or admitting when i am wrong but when i admit my\nerror and encounter an argument of what degree of obvious my error\npossessed, it is . . . shall we say annoying. i agree with you that\nfringe issues determine outcomes of votes. my position is that they\nalso can turn a good bill into a bad bill and this bill has so much\ninterest i want no fringe interest to cloud the issues. when\nsupermarket baggers and gas station attendants are talking about this\narcane stuff it needs to be accepted that this is of unusually\nwidespread interest for a complex accounting/economy bill. congress\ndemands transparency of corporations, why shouldn't i demand the same\nof them? as i said before, i am against government setting limits on\ncompensation but agree it is certainly a topic that can be addressed.\ni just don't want to see in this bill. now that it is obviously not\ngoing to be rushed through, maybe we can discuss it. but it's presence\nin the bill voted on was solely pandering in my opinion. 2. gotcha\nquestions are about winning debate points instead of exchanging ideas,\nopinions and information. they are objectionable to me probably for\nthe same reason that the aggressive language i use is objectionable to\nyou. it shows a lack of respect, for the other party, the seriousness\nof the issues and the exchange of opinions itself. while i am not\nabove it, i find it intellectually dishonest to go for winning debate\npoints instead of just making one's point. and to me gotcha doesn't\nmean pointing out one's mistakes. i am much more nasty in print than\nin person. i guess it is just intensity that causes me not to always\nsee how something sounds/looks in print. i hear in my head the\nmessage, not the words. 3. i was not saying all of congress is bad. i\nseveral times listed the three i hold as representative of those\nresponsible. but just like i cannot print \"in my opinion\" after every\nsentence i type, i find it easier to type \"congress\" rather than\n\"chucky, barney and chrissy\" every time (plus it minimizes my\ndemeaning use of the familiar diminutive forms of their names if i use\nthem too often :) ) so when i say congress in that context, i am\ntalking about those members guilty of the actions i decry. just like\nwhen you talk about fat cat ceos or overpaid execs, you don't mean all\nexecs; i am sure you don't mean john mackey of whole foods market. my\nposts are surely long winded enough without making e type lists of\nspecific congressmen each time. surely if i type out the unholy\ntrinity a few times, you get the message when i cut back to just\nsaying \"congress\" when my fingers begin to cramp. deregulation is a\nrepublican cornerstone. no argument here. it is one reason i consider\nmyself a republican even when the republican party has very little\nresemblance to classic republican positions any more. the republican\nparty, my party has been hijacked and it pisses me off to no end. i am\nnot even mad at democrats. they do what dems are supposed to do. i am\ntruly pissed off at my own party because when we controlled the\nexecutive and legislative branches, we squandered the opportunity to\ndo everything we as republicans stood for and instead spent money like\ndrunken democrats. the only things we accomplished in our period of\ncontrolling 2 and nearly a third branch of government is to give away\nour image as the more competent party in terms of governance and\nbetter party for foreign affairs/domestic security. so believe me. i\nunderstand who is for deregulation. my positions are that the\ndemocrats do more damage passing regulation than republicans do\navoiding it and that when they can use regulation to pad their\ncampaign coffers, frank, shumer, obama and dodd have proven to be all\nfor regulation and have been as vicious as a momma bear in protecting\ntheir cubs (atms) when greenspan, bush and mccain (among others) tried\nto introduce regulation designed in a very narrow focus on preventing\nexactly the problems we are facing now. so while deregulation might be\na classic republican issue, i would assert that the republican party\nhas little resemblance to classic republican planks and further assert\nthat when faced with regulations which threaten to shut off their\nspigots of cash, the democrats aren't as pro regulation as you might\nbelieve listening to obama now. pardon the non sequiter but just\nimagine how much money came obama's way from fannie and freddie for\nhim to take in more in two years than all other senators but one\n(barney frank) did in nine years! do you think his years working for\nand with acorn might have had something to do with such a windfall for\na freshman senator? and yes, i am saying that acorn is just another\n\"bad guy\" on obama's rolodex of \"acquaintances\" with ayres and wright\nand farrakhan et al. so i guess mys response is that republicans are\nalways against deregulation as a philosophical point. but with the mac\nand mae and acorns of the world, it was the dems who killed any\nregulation. and for purely financial, political self interest, not any\nphilosophical reasons. before you extrapolate from that, i am not\nsaying dems are evil and republicans are pure of thought and spirit.\njust limiting the discussion to the specifics of our current topic\nwhich is the \"bailout bill\" and my assertions that democratic\ntreatment of fannie and freddie and acorn was the largest single\nimpetus for this crisis. i admit i don't know the history of\nrepublican efforts for deregulation other than those surrounding the\ngrammy bill that allowed the travelers deals with salomon, shearson\nlehman, primerica, barclays and citibank. i tried to use the gramm\nbill to pass a law myself in conjunction with jack kemp, using cra to\nforce the non bank aspects of these huge merged companies to offer\nservices to help lower income persons. i wanted the brokers to offer\nfree ira accounts so someone who could only invest $100 a month didn't\nhave to pay a fee that ate up all of his contributions and get cra\ncredits for doing so, just like banks do for loaning to those folks.\nfor what it is worth, i also used cra to build and sell low income\nhousing in inner cities. lost my shirt but had more fun than any other\nbusiness i ever started. this was all back in the early and mid\nnineties so you can see i come by my knowledge of cra honestly and it\ngoes way back. i disclose this to prove that i once was idealistic\nenough to think i could influence the government, now i just try to\nunderstand what it is doing. the tensions between labor and capital,\nregulation and deregulation, socialism and democracy and spending and\nsavings are all natural states. in this country the pendulum never\nsettles in the middle, it swings from one extreme to the other. it is\nthe job of the govt to be in the middle reducing the friction and\narbitrating between the two. when industrialists abused labor, they\nstepped in with regulations on child labor, minimum wages, work week\nlimits etc. when unions got heavy handed they stopped destructive work\nstoppages. when deregulation was stifling progress in the financial\nmarkets which had changed from the thirties they lessened regulations.\ni am not blaming deregulation for this crisis because the gramm bill\ndid not lead to the problems that specifically have created this\ncrisis. i am sure it exacerbated the issues in ways i am not aware of\nbut the direct causes of the crisis are traceable, imo directly to\nmandated sub prime loans and mark to market both of which came from\nbad regulations, not lack of good regulations. i lay the lion's share\nof the blame on congress, or that specific subset i keep naming,\nbecause: 1. they mandated actions which started the mess 2. they\nkilled regulations undoing the damage they had done 3. they killed it\nfor purely financial and political self interest. 4. they expect us to\nlet them manage the fix to the problem they created 5. they have not\nadmitted the role they played and instead point their fingers at\nothers and act \"holier than thou\". 4. i am in no position to even put\nforth a plan and call it comprehensive and to say i know the\nramifications of any plan i might propose. i have some strong feelings\nabout a framework but details are way over my head. a. i think we cant\njust remove the bad debt blocking up the credit plumbing. we need to\ndo something more comprehensive imo. i hate to be a broken record but\nif we can't break the pattern of partisan gotcha oneupmanship and\nparty over country, not much else matters. i think we need to\nlegislate with the knowledge and acceptance that parties will push the\nlimits around the edges for profit. legislation should be overseen and\nrevisited regularly. you cannot have a barney frank mandating\npolitically correct loans at the expense of fiscally correct loans.\nbusiness has to be able to conduct business. wall street is good for\nmain street, not toxic to main street. they have a symbiotic\nrelationship which true, does sometimes swing too far toward either\nextreme of the arc. every working american should have a stake in wall\nstreet. we can ban or regulate derivatives and mbss and risk\nmitigating securities. i do like the idea out forth on the video that\nkukla put on this thread of using exchanges to regulate derivative\nactivity instead of legislating them. frankly i don't understand the\nramifications but that aspect appeals to me. i think mark to market\nhas to go because it exaggerates accounting gains in good times and\nexacerbates losses in bad times. both are dangerous. i think we need\nto go back to a cap of 12 percent leverage, allow shorting but\nreinstate the uptick rule, up the insurance aspects of our governments\nrole but lessen the participation in investments (ie. warrants). one\nexception to this but it would be a whole new discussion is this. if\nwe take the $700b, and put into social security as the beginnings of a\nplan to partially privatize it, it would be a hugely complicated\nendeavor but i believe it is the only way to save social security. i\ndo not believe that taxpayers should be \"investing\" in companies\nbecause of the risk factors we discussed earlier. you cannot get a\nreturn without risk. so we have to risk losing all 700b in order to\nget a return on it. our budget cant take that hit. but since i believe\nthat social security as currently constituted is dead and the only\nquestion is when, we have nothing to lose and much to gain by coming\nup with a means of privatizing social security. if we take $1t worth\nof warrants in the firms we saved, mortgages and physical real estate,\nwe can start to privatize it without the government disrupting the\nmarket by dumping huge $$ into the market as social security\ninvestments. it also means we can use money coming in to pay current\npayments due and credit the new money coming in against an existing\npool of assets obtained in this \"bailout\" measure. this would be rife\nwith danger but if you agree that social security is the walking dead\nalready, what are we really risking? part of my thinking is that all\namericans should be treated the same to whatever extent is possible. i\nbelieve welfare is toxic. when i sold low income housing there was no\nsweat equity and it was not run as a non profit. i could have created\na non profit and raised money for it and paid myself a wage. that is\nthe way most people do it including obama as a community organizer.\nbut that is anathema to me. i wanted to prove that as a republican i\ncould operate as a for profit and build a three bedroom, one and a\nhalf bath home, 1050 square feet in the inner city which sold for\nunder $48k without treating the buyer as a welfare case. we used cra\nto get banks to give us loans designed for our program. we used the\nurban league to educate and do credit counseling so that buyers could\nqualify for a loan just like you or i do. granted they had special\nhelp and special programs but they didn't have to use sweat equity and\ncharity. turned out that i could not compete with the non profits. not\nfinancially but cities and pols wouldn't let me pay them for land off\nthe unpaid tax rolls when they could give it to habitat and have a\nphoto op with jimmy carter. another example is what i mentioned\nearlier. i wanted to extend iras to folks who could not afford enough\nmoney per year to have it make sense to pay merrill lynch an annual\nfee on what might only be 200 or 500 dollars a year. why pay 5% to 10%\nof that in a fee? so i wanted to use cra to force merrill etc. to give\nfree accounts to less wealthy folks. it might not accumulate enough to\nreplace social security but if it totals 100k after 40 years, that\nain't so bad as a supplement! this lets those folks invest for\nretirement just like you or i or bill gates (ok, bit of a stretch)\nwould do. i think it is very empowering for someone to have a home and\na retirement fund. i think it would lessen what i consider to be\nirrational anger at wall street which obama etc are fueling. they need\nhelp but not charity. or as my hero jack kemp said \"empowerment, not\nentitlement.\" that is my version i guess of compassionate\nconservatism. i believe that republican classic values are no less\ncompassionate than democratic ones. we just go at it from a different\nphilosophical bent. i believe that it is bad for society and the\nindividual to perpetuate welfare. i think charity has a place but i\nthink giving with no hand up drags down the spirit. i understand that\nthe starving have no room for spirit until they are fed but i think we\ncan make folks feel good about themselves by treating them as\ncitizens, not charity cases. interestingly, just like barney frank et\nal's desire to do good had unfortunate consequences (imo), every\nattempt of mine to do social good has had costs. difference is mine\ncost me money, not the country its economy. ok, i have babbled on\nabout a lot more stuff than anyone here could possibly care about so\nlet me apologize to anyone still reading this blog version of war and\npeace. i know i didn't answer you on specifics of what i want to see\nbut i copped out and told you mostly what i don't want. sorry but just\nbecause i talk a lot doesn't mean that i know any more than you about\nthe details of this mess. i know what i have had reason to learn and i\ncan apply that to a little more but this mess is an octopus with\neighty arms instead of eight",
                " this is long, but, i hope it gives you valuable thoughts. i have\nconcerns about trump, mostly on his articulation and experience, not\njust political experience but just being adequately studied on\npolitical procedure and current events. he would need a really strong\ncabinet, in areas he's not strong in. but as far as the statement you\nmade here, it\u2019s not actually a real or accurate evaluation of trump\nnor the situation surrounding trump. these statement and other\naccusations are not sensible, logical arguments. trump actually wants\nto protect people\u2019s rights. including women and blacks. you have to\nunderstand the personality of trump\u2026. i\u2019m a women and he doesn\u2019t\nbother me. he is a hot head. he is not politically correct. he steps\nin shit when he opens his mouth, not because his motives are bad or\nevil, not because he is a dictator, and not because he's a racist, or\nhates women. it\u2019s because he never really had to package his words\ncarefully, and he didn\u2019t intend to run for office. i\u2019m not saying\ntrump is qualified in my opinion to be president. but, i am saying:\nmany things you see at this time are provoked. he, trump, is a hot\nhead, he is provoked. black lives matter are hotheads they are\nprovoked. and they exploit and media exploits. much is taken out of\ncontext. many things trump has ever said in the past is just trump\nbeing trump. a celebrity, a big talker, a hot head, a real estate\ntycoon, a guy from new york. to vilifying trump is actually inaccurate\nand off base. he is not, and he should not be an excuse for a bunch of\npeople to make a platform, and lead the country by \u201cmob rules\nbehavior,\u201d and \u201cforce a power of influence and authority\u201d over\neveryone, through intimidation. i do have logically based concerns\nabout trump as president. such as \u2013 cruz brought to our attention that\ntrump is in litigation and may be sued for an expensive real estate\ncourse he ran, so being involved in that, depending on the details may\nbe a true, tangible, measurable and factual concern. the series of off\nthe cuff remarks made through his lifetime, many out of context, and\nothers in my opinion are just mouthy hot head words without a\npolitically correct filter! i didn\u2019t like his reaction to meagan kelly\nduring and after the first debate. but i don't see it as \u201chating women\nor devaluing women,\u201d i see it as he was backed into a corner, and he\nreally isn\u2019t accustomed to. and he doesn't adjust his reactions. he\nsimply is just rash, with brute honesty, wears his feelings and\nattitudes on his sleeve, and honestly just opens his mouth and steps\nin shit, and he does so in reaction at the moment, and in the heat of\nthe moment. trump is like many people i have experienced, and maybe,\neven a little like myself. so i get the crap that falls out of his\nmouth in the heat of the moment. but to vilify him by these things is\nmore of a salem witch hunt, than a true reasonable evaluation. i can\nsee why some people would say or feel things they do, or form opinions\nby what he has said or says. but there is a huge overreaction to all\nof it! and, it isn\u2019t balanced! here is trump in a nutshell: he is a\nhigh d personality traitss with a secondary high i personality traits\nhe has a low level s personality traits he had a low level c\npersonality traits and that is most likely his disc profile. (below is\na basic view of disc personality traits) d - dominant traits i -\ninspiring traits s \u2013 serving traits c \u2013 cautious traits so, i\u2019ll\nexplain why accusing trump of having an interest or a motive in taking\nrights away is an off base accusation. 1st of all, ask yourself why???\nwhy would he? and, why would he logically want to? 1st put yourself in\nhis perspective\u2026. it may surprise you. your really not as important as\nyou think you are to trump. or, let\u2019s rephrase that to understand\nexactly what i mean by that. he actually doesn\u2019t need to be president.\ni really think trump was drinking a beer and said \u201dshit, i can fix\nthis, maybe i should run for president!\u201d there\u2019s a funny of trump\nfacebook post that says that. but, the real funny part of the post is,\ni think its closer to being true than not true!! he doesn\u2019t need to be\npresident, he doesn\u2019t need you, and he doesn\u2019t need to make you\nimportant to himself at all. he doesn\u2019t even need your approval in\nlife, and he doesn\u2019t need, or want your rights! your life, your local\neconomy, your future security, your unemployment or your ability or\ninability to charge a reasonable bid as a handyman because of\ncompeting below market bids on projects by under the table alien\nworkers - that take away your jobs and your income potential and then\nleave you at a disadvantage, unable to take care of yourself and your\nfamily! none of these things, that affect you, actually will ever\naffect trump or his family, at all. if mexican immigrants get the jobs\nyou didn\u2019t get. trump doesn\u2019t have to pay your mortgage, your\nelectric, your grocery bill, and your education etc\u2026 to trump, whether\nyou have a job or not, really doesn\u2019t have any effect on trump\u2019s life\nnor anyone he cares about! as far as terrorism, and your safe\ntraveling on commercial airplanes, that is the least important thing\npersonally to trump! why? because he actually has his own plane! he\ndoesn\u2019t need or want your social security check, your unemployment\ncheck, he doesn\u2019t have to pay your healthcare or obamacare premiums,\nhe doesn\u2019t compete in your job market, he doesn\u2019t walk your streets\nand encounter your neighborhood crime, nor does he encounter your\nareas crime done by undocumented immigrants. the reality is, some\nillegals are or could be potential rapists murderers or thieves! wait\na minute, how dare he say that about illegal aliens, you bigot. there\ni said it for you! now, you wait a minute. here is some common sense\nthoughts you should also consider when forming your opinions.\nactually, illegals come in the usa, without required records. we have\nno idea who or where they are, and we have no ability to do any\nhomework on them, on their background, or even varify their real\nnames! because there is no id or passport required when you are\nillegal! so, through legal immigration, we are more able to reject the\nentrance of criminals, and drug smugglers. another thought, and please\nunderstand, i\u2019m making a point not being cruel. but, the ones who come\nillegally, come from the poorest and most crime ridden areas of\nmexico. these are the people who are the least likely to ever afford\nto come legally. now, make comparisons between illegals and legals.\nallowing legals in the usa - we have more ability to vet them and\nreject criminals, because it is required that they have records, and\nids and a passports. but illegals, there is a higher chance of letting\nin criminals. why? 1 - because criminals can\u2019t easily come here\nlegally, so they have to come illegally and 2 - most illegals are\ncoming from the poorest areas that have the highest concentration of\ncrime. and illegals are traveling from these areas and with criminals.\nwhat they are fleeing, high crime, and poverty and desperation is what\nthey are bringing with them. without our ability to vet them, no\nrecords, no health records, no criminal backgrounds, no proof of id or\npassports! and 3 - mwxico is more than happy to send their criminals\nover to be our problem, instead of theirs! back to trump: he is a\ncitizen like us, looking at areas the usa is messing up, and he is\nlooking at these big problems, and his possible solutions as a\nmotivation and a platform, and he thinks he can fix it. whether he can\nor not, isn\u2019t relevant at the moment. because, what we are discussing\nhere is... when you slice up trump what is inside. his motives? his\nwhy? he didn\u2019t just decide to run to prove himself. he actually\ndoesn\u2019t need to prove himself, especially not to you or me. he didn\u2019t\ndecide i feel like spending millions in running for president, because\nthat would be a prestigeous thing to do. he is business wealthy, not\npolitician wealthy. politicians have career goas leading to a\npresidential dreams. trump probably didn\u2019t have becoming president on\nhis career goal list, and probably not even on his jump out of a\nplane, ride the biggest roller coaster, buy an island \u2026. and\neverything else, bucket list! trumps business background: many\nsuccessful people had bankruptcies and use legal loopholes to build\nbusinesses. and atlantic city has been put out of business just about,\natlantic city is a big mess in the tristate area. because states who\ndidn\u2019t allow gambling, now do. so there are more local options for\ngambling and less people doing to atlantic city. so atlantic city\ntanked, atlantic municipality actually just shut down and closed their\ngovernment doors (for months or maybe more) because literally, their\nbroke! so regardless, trump had great success, and is a business man.\nand, managing a big budget, of many businesses all at 1 time, and\nlowering expenses and deficiencies is something that is actually in\nhis wheelhouse! these are areas he sees as things that someone needs\nto step up and fix around here in the usa. now, he is approaching\nissues from a citizens perspective and business perspective and he is\nthinking, \"i can fix this. someone has to get this stuff under a\nmanageable control,\" ....or america may face bankruptcy, bad credit,\ngovernment shut downs, refusal of future credit, or have no ability to\nborrow, maybe foreclosure (of a country?), or the inability to pay\nsalaries, or provide benefits or funding or care or social security\nchecks or welfare checks or unemployment checks, or health care\npremiums for obamacare\u2026 etc. he sees policies that are hurting\namericans, and his approach is from a common sense citizen and a\nbusiness perspective: 1- trading and american businesses \u2013 trading\ngoods with china and others, and american companies who brought their\nbusiness to other countries, (trump has bought, sold, and run\ncompanies abroad also) so as a business person he answers the problem\nby strategies to strengthen opportunities, jobs, and make and sell\nmore products locally, to strengthen our economy, reduce inflation,\nand make life more affordable for everybody. make sense? this is a\nreasonable approach. and, this approach isn't selective help according\nto race, gender, sex orientation etc\u2026 because it will help everyone\nacross the board, and raise many black and white people out of\npoverty, and there will be more money in our economy, in our local\ncommunities, and in households, and probably significantly will raise\ntax revenue from everyone, and for everyone\u2019s benefit. bringing\nbusinesses home raise tax revenue from big business, which is big\nmoney, to add to our american pocketbook. 2- immigration - he doesn't\nhate mexicans, and he doesn't hate muslims. he hates \u201cthe problems\u201d we\nhave, that happen to include some people from these 2 groups. again,\nhe is using a common sense citizen/businessman approach to problems\nand solutions. so 1st, lets all get in the driver seat, and lets all\nmake the most logical determination for policies, in response to \u201call\nthe problems.\u201d in our homes we can't pay the electric bill, and ignore\nthe water bill. but, if push comes to shove, we may do without a\ndinner out, or maybe, even do without cable tv for a few months. these\nare logical household management decisions that we all may have had to\nmake at sometime. apply the same principles to our problems in the\nusa. in the same way, we have to divide our resources, and address\neverything and every problem in balance, according to priority and our\nfuture stability and safety. so when discussing the issue of\nimmigration - 1st we have to define the problems and 2nd we have to\nanswer the problem. and we have to answer the problem with 1st making\nsure \u201cour own house\u201d has a reasonable ability to survive and thrive.\nand if we spread ourselves thin, that it\u2019s not too thin, and it won't\nadd more damages to our already struggling family! - so, then\nregarding 1 problem with many sub- problems immigration: illegal\naliens, the potential for terrorism, the vetting process, the current\njob market in the usa, our own crime and then the added crime of some\nillegal aliens, our own struggles within our own communities and our\nown country - racial tensions, poverty, education, home land security,\nlaw enforcement, health insurance, medicare, our seniors,\nunemployment, underemploymwnt, international relationships, any and\nall issues, threats, and tensions, our military defense, intelligence,\nand military responsibilities and action, green card holders, and\nmore... etc... (reduce it all to small terms and apply a common sense\nexample) - we have a good little family, we are compassionate and help\nothers. but we have a limit on ability. we have limits on the good we\ncan do, and regardless of what we would like to do, the good we can do\nis limited by our ability and resources. we are limited by our own\nincome, our bills, our discretionary income, our by our own progress\nand goals as a family unit, and of each individual person within our\nown family. we also have many other obligations - our aging parents,\nother people that are directly in our path that have needs, planning\nour own years of retirement, and personal and our children\u2019s\neducation, and providing for the now and later needs and wants and\ngoals for ourselves, our children, and our grandchildren, and then\nalso more, other community involvements we are a part of like churches\nor other groups and charities that are important to us ... then\nwhatever is left over after we have met or managed the immediate\ndemands around us, what is leftover if any, is all that we have to\nwork with. we all have to understand, we just can't give everyone a\nbetter life, because 1 - it is not realistic 2 - it will hurt our\nimmediate and extended family. it would take from their basic needs,\nand also would put their future stability at risk 3 - it would prevent\nstability and goals both collectively and personally. hurting our\neconomic improvements, current growth, and future gains. well, the\ngovernment spending and budget- federal, state, and local are similar\nin comparison, but just on a way bigger and broader scale! so, when\ntrump says, \"close the boarder\" and \"build a wall,\" he isn't being\ncallus or a bigot. he is taking each of these real issues, i\nmentioned, effecting immigration and he is applying a common sense\napproach for answers according to the whole picture of immigration\ncombined with the whole picture of all the other issues in light of\nour household budget, our projected future earnings, and our already\naccrued rising national debt, along with the interest on the money we\nalready owe - (which is billions and growing by adding on top growing\nunpaid interest and also more added new debt from all the short falls\nfrom yearly spending we don\u2019t cover now by tax revenue. so this is our\nhousehold budget, and our spending and our bills are not even close to\nbeing covered. the debt grows and grows with what we don\u2019t cover in\ntaxes after our bills are paid. and that is huge!! so take issues\nsurrounding immigration, and answer it. understand the why, ask more\nquestions, see what we are willing to do without, an what we can\u2019t di\nwithout. and if you cut from priority areas, like military or\nretirement social security or medicare or education. make sure you ask\nmore questions and more question and weigh every possible problem or\nconsequence. before you make your opinion and chase idiot know it\nalls, that actually are likely the least educated among us. maybe even\nenemies of america for all you know!"

                " it seems that you are forgetting that the thesis of my first argument\nwas islam is made up of rules, and sanctions for violating those very\nrules, in as much as any society. the fact that human rights are being\nabused is a fault of the government and not the religion. the\nsanctions within islam are human rights violations. women are\nsanctioned by islam to be inferior to men, and there is no tolerance\nfor other beliefs. you either convert to the religion, die, or in some\nrare cases are treated as a second-class citizen known as a dhimmi.\nblasphemy, which encompasses any criticism of the religion, is\npunished by death. this is what sharia is, it is a stone-age set of\nrules for how to conduct society that has draconian punishments for\nthe most innocuous of of behaviours. amputations for theft. death for\napostasy. the government is supposed to be responsible for the abuse\nof human rights and if those rights are not tend to, then it becomes\nthe fault and negligence of the government in their incompetent\nleadership. the government is merely following religious dogma,\nbecause in these cases the state is a theocratic one and the quran\nsupersedes state authority, as defined in the constitutions. what this\nreally means is that imams and clerics run the state from the\nbackground and use barbarous punishments to force their societies into\nprimitive social conditions. islam is not a tolerant or enlightened\nreligion, so it must follow that any state which follows its values\ncan never escape barbarism, but the catch is that due to islam's\nstatus as a religion with god-given laws, and the punishment for\nblasphemy being death, it means that these states can never blame\nislam for gender inequality, or human rights violations. to do so\nwould be like blaming god for his system not working. therefore\nislam's problems are ignored or blamed on something external. if what\nthat father did to his son (which by the way, i do not support) was\nlawful in a country with islamic laws, then why did he had to flee the\ncountry where the crime was committed if according to you, there is\nlittle respect for human rights? was it that he was scared of being\npunished by the laws? because turkey is a secular state, just like the\nunited states, which means that he doesn't have a sharia court and law\nto back him. that's an important point here, turkey is suffering from\nislamic fundamentalism just like the united states has christian\nfundamentalism. both have their own creationists, their own hate-\nmongers. however in turkey one of the big social problems is honour\nkillings. i think the only thing that lets our nation maintain decency\nsometimes is our bitter struggle to defend free speech and our use of\nit to expose and ridicule fundamentalism here. in turkey there doesn't\nseem to be as much of this, and indeed a number of works have been\ncensored there due to muslim sensitivities. if more turkish men and\nwomen were outspoken against islam, they might see a more free society\nthere. i reemphasised on the point that islam is not the only source\nof rules and punishment because the conclusion or thesis of my\nargument is the fact that islam is in as much as any other religion or\nsociety. therefore, my arguments are based on my thesis or conclusion.\nno it isn't. islam is one of the most violent religions on earth. it\nnot only condones but praises religious violence. christianity\ncondones religious violence but is less explicit, and judaism is a\nsevere minority so it has hardly the following to do any damage. which\nis also just a minor point compared to the fact that it was in\nchristian empires that an enlightenment occurred which undermined\nreligious authority and set us on the path for liberal democracies.\nislam hasn't had this outcome. it is hardly changed from centuries ago\nin terms of social reform. the biggest mistake people make is in\nconsidering islam just another religion. the other problem with this\nis that it is a kind of admission that as long as it is a religion,\neverything done in its name may be forgiven. people kill each other\nevery day in the name of islam and just because it is a religion does\nnot mean it deserves a free pass for this. nazism is an ideology and\nmillions died in the name of it. we don't forgive nazism as being\nunblamable for these atrocities. the same is true for communism and\nfascism. we do not forgive these ideologies for the deaths suffered\ndue to their influence on the human mind. why defend islam? billions\nof people are living repressed lifestyles because of it, but it gets a\nfree pass? are you kidding me here? the united states is a secular\nnation but as far as i am aware of, executions in the united states\ntook place as a result of traditional and religious punishment. that\ncan be traced back to the origin of the capital punishment in the\nunited states. you'd better list some examples then. i'm not\nconsidering lynch mobs, by the way, these are illicit murders handled\nby mob justice. we do have laws against cruel and unusual punishment\nbut how many were innocently and brutally executed before those laws\nwere implemented? in case you are forgetting, early executions in the\nunited states were by hanging, burning, drowning, beheading and many\nmore until the supreme court made specific rulings on the\nconsitutionality of the methods of punishment used in capital\npunishment. the eighth amendment was adopted in 1791, as part of our\nbill of rights. how many people are innocently stoned to death every\nweek, burned to death, drowned, buried alive, beheaded, and amputated\nin the middle eastern islamic states? if you tried to change their\nways against such brutal punishments you would be branded as a kafir,\nbecause they are merely following holy law. even if we accept that it\ntook many painful deaths to arrive at lethal injection here, your\nargument resonates most clearly against the islamic states you\nindirectly defend by passing islam off as peaceful.\nhttp://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/ descriptions-execution-methods also,\nhow come the u.s supreme court ruled that it was not unconstitutional\nto execute a man the second time after the electric chair electrocuted\nbut not to the extent of killing him due to a mechanical error but\nordered his execution for the second time? i was under the impression\nthat these rulings were due to legal precedent. you will need to be\nmore specific. in the past, the death penalty was given for the\noffense of rape until the laws were ammended and various appeals were\nfiled with the supreme court. i agree that we do not punish the\nvictims, but in the past, victims of rape were allowed to be\nquestioned about their past sexual history and then that line of\nquestioning was used against the victims by making them appear as\nliars or prostitutes in the minds of the judge or jury. worlds\ndifferent from taking a rape victim and putting them into jail. didnt\nin the past also, homosexuality was a crime. werent people arrested\nand prosecuted for homosexuality as a crime? homosexuality was even\nregarded as a mental disorder and still does according the opinions of\nmany. again, this doesn't support your case because in islamic states\nhomosexuals are executed. they are thanking god whenever they commit\nan act of terrorism but do you think that they are doing it for their\nreligion or their country? do you think that the source of these\nactions are of a political nature and because they express thanks to\ngod for their actions does not mean that islam favors their actions. i\nsuggest you try reading from the horse's mouth. an example is the\nislamist alliance's proclamation in somalia: excerpts below history\nhas shown us that muslims were not able to achieve glory and propagate\ntheir religion except through their unity and holding on to the rope\nof allah; and that muslims have never tasted humiliation of defeat\nexcept when they were divided... this tragedy, however, will not end\nexcept with the unification of muslims on the basis of islam and the\nmethodology of ahlu sunna wal jama\u2019 and not on the basis of secular\nnationalism. we have also agreed upon the following: - working towards\nthe establishment of the islamic caliphate upon the path of the\nprophet. - waging jihad in the cause of allah to accomplish tawheed\nand eradicate polytheism until allah is worshiped alone without\npartners - confrontation of the global zionist-christian crusade and\nits suppression. - application of the shariah of allah and the\nadministration of justice and elimination of injustice. - the\napplication of the ideology of alliance and enmity ( al wala wal bara)\n- restoration of the islamic sanctities and cleansing them from the\njews, christians and apostates - supporting the oppressed and freeing\nthe muslim prisoners - nification of the muslim ummah upon the banner\nof tawheed - creation of a cohesive muslim society that is guided by a\ncorrect ideology, islamic morals and shariah source (more exist, this\nis just a blog that copied and pasted it):\nhttp://occident.blogspot.com/ the point is that these people are\nacting under religious motivations which determine their politics in\nsome way. if that was indeed the case, then how come many muslims and\nthese are not just muslims but strong level of faith belief muslims\ncame out and spoke against the act of many of their other muslims? and\nhow come did the islamic law not prosecute these muslims or muslim\norganisations? in a free society they are allowed to condemn each\nother verbally. in an islamic society they risk violence for blasphemy\nor simply going against the social norms of their area. in islamic\nsocieties the condemnation seems to stem from sectarianism, always the\nsunni and shia against each other, calling each other infidels and\napostates. i agree that we are dealing with a mordern act, so the\ndepartment of homeland security and the fbi unlike the laws were\ncreated in modern society but they also have a different but similar\ndefinition of the term terrorism in that the word terrorism \"is a\npolitically motivated act.\" why did the u.s and the mid east\nencountered a dispute? i do not suspect in the least amount that all\nit takes is for religion to spark a dispute, it is more than religion,\nit has to do with the politics involved in international relations and\ntrade. the difference is a matter of scope. when you have an\nindividual who is engaged in violence, it is a matter of personal\nbeliefs. when you have one mob fighting another, it is sectarianism\n(religion). when you have a nation fighting the other (or nation-wide\nmilitary organisations) it is political. the top-down version is that\nthe leaders of al-qaeda, the taliban and their hundreds of offshoots\nare fighting for purely political reasons (they want to be the future\nleaders of a megastate and see islam as a means to this end) but they\nrecruit people based on religion (these recruits believe that they are\nacting for god) and there are many casual supporters (they just\nbelieve as they were raised to). the religion makes allowances for\nviolence and so it is very easily used to gain supporters for\nparticularly violent movements. imagine trying to do the same thing\nwith buddhists or jainists. how could you convince a population of\nlargely nonviolent conviction that personal offense must lead to\nexecution? how would you gain their support for implementing laws that\ntreat women like slaves? it would be possible but much more difficult.\nwith islam we see ideas and indoctrinated culture that is ripe for\nmanipulation. while i would agree that islam is a religion of peace, i\ndo not agree with the way the government has executed it's functions.\nmy country of origin is also a country where islam is practised, but\nyet the chief prosecutor of my country is a muslim woman and she is\npart of an international islamic organisation. you mean maria bashir?\nshe's been on a hit list for some time. it really shows how much\nmuslim men fear women and their ability to succeed in society. while\nmy country is not built upon islamic laws, women like the one i\npreviously mentioned would be counted as sinners because they are\nsupposed to be the inferior housewife type that is subjected to the\nrules of their male counterparts in islam but unlike what you are\nclaiming, this is not the case. women has always been considered as\nbeing the inferior type but many efforts are being made to change the\nperception of those who would think so. what matters here is that\nislam systematically places women into a role that is little different\nfrom property. oppression of women and homosexuals exists in many\nother societies as well, and not only islamic societies. it has to do\nwith traditions. and as far as i am aware of, every religion counts\nhomosexuality as a sin and expects women to abide by the rules her\nhusbands makes. matriarchies have existed in the past, and societies\nlike the greek and roman empires were very tolerant of homosexuality.\nwhat is important to remember is that a religion is created from the\nlocal culture of origin and then is spread like a virus, taking those\nvalues with it. islam and judaism originated in the middle east and\ntook their views on women from those cultures. they then spread those\nviews across the world. i however do not support the oppression of\nhomosexuals and women, is why i am publishing a paper on these two\nissues highlighting the origin of these issues in the victorian era.\nthey did not originate in that era, however. they have existed for\ncenturies as part of religion, and before those religions as parts of\nancient cultures. islam forbids political activity to be closely\nassociated with religion so if the state is in a political dispute and\nthey provide funding to a terrorist group, it no longer becomes a\nreligious act but a political act of vengeance. try reading inspire\nand jihad recollections. they seem to not care about your theological\ndistinction. to them politics and religion are part of the same thing.",
                " you can't twist law to coform to a religious belief. and you can't\ncreate a law in respect of a religion. thats not constitutional. your\npost is almost crazy paranoid, when really its the other way around\nthat is more likely concern. it's an absurd line of thought. its like\nyou all don't know what to yell about next. there is no such thing as\nmaking society conform to a narrow view of religion through\ngovernment. what would religion force that is a narrow view? cultural\nstandards of right and wrong, moral authority, kindness and charity\nare defined from something and from somewhere. and your concience is\nyour adjuster, it keeps you within acceptable standards, its your bar\nyou reach for. it also the standard inside yourself that corrects you\nwhen you go below acceptable standards. if you gathered these values\nfrom your christian parents, whether you like it or not, it was the\ncultural influence that defined your concious. you answer to something\ninside. our laws are based on moral concience of right and wrong, as\ndefined within judeo christian standards of morality. the value of\nhuman life, the freedom of choice by free will, judicial fairness in\ntrials and punishment, the golden rule, rights, tolerance, promises,\nresponsibilities, actions, and reactions. high standards and also low\nstandards of conduct are defined within you by the acceptable norm of\ncultural standards. separation of church and state doesn't have very\nmuch to do with standard of right and wrong. we don't create laws\nbased on a specific religion, and we don't allow specific religious\ndoctrine to apply when in contradiction to law. issues of abortion and\ngay marriage, you don't have to be religious to agree or disagree with\neither of these. aboruntion from an economic standpoint is wasteful,\nand morally, i personally believe life starts at conception. i oppose\nabortion beyond the morning after pill. and birthcontrol is both\neconomically sound and morally sound. but these issues are neither\nreligious government or secular government. we are not secular. we\nhave moral roots that define our basic definition of right and wrong,\nand fair and unfair. and that is the standard of cultural norm in\namerican society. none of like when people don't keep an acceptable\nlevel of our cultural standard. we apply our law as common sense, a\nguide of concience. how often do we have to look up a law to tell us\nright or wrong. and how often does society punish through the courts\nwhen someone is acting in good concience according to our cultural\nnorm? even atheists who come from a family of atheist, in america, are\ngoverned by the cultural norm of right and wrong, which is based on\nvalues with roots in judaism and christianity. look at israel,\npredominately high moral standards and high values regarding life. the\nstandard of cultural norm of right and wrong, is very different than\nthe countries that surround them. look at countries that surround\nthem, more serial killers in 1 area the size of a town than all of\namerica has born in a lifetime."

                " alright, since you insist on continuing to argue, and i hate to drop\nan argument when my opponent doesn't want to, i will oblige. i will\ntake it one step at a time. before i do anything else, i want to clear\nup two issues that have been muddying the waters for several posts,\nand also put an end to an issue that i think has been resolved.\n-------------------------------- muddy issue a: the use of non-human\nexamples you keep saying \"we're only talking about humans here, so\nstop raising non-human examples\", even though i mentioned earlier that\ni'm supposed to raise non-human examples. but since you didn't catch\nmy meaning, i will explain in more detail: (1) there is a category of\nthings called \"human beings\". (3) some clear examples of human beings\nare human children and human adults. (4) some clear examples of non-\nhuman beings are giraffes, cats, spiders, bacteria, arms, kidneys, and\nfingernails. (5) there is a lot of dispute over whether or not\n\"foetus\" fits into the human being category. (6) our current debate\nconcerns whether or not \"foetus\" fits into the human being category.\nyou say that it does. i say that it doesn't. (7) in order to figure\nout whether it fits into the human being category, or into some non-\nhuman being category, we need to look at the big picture: look at\nthings that are human beings, and look at things that are not human\nbeings, and see where foetuses go. let's use an analogy: imagine a\nsuspect is on trial for robbery. the trial would consist of looking at\nevidence that he did commit a robbery, and looking at evidence that he\ndid not commit a robbery, and seeing which side is more convincing.\n(8) i think that foetuses are not human beings, and i raise examples\nof things that are clearly not human beings to support my argument.\n(9) you are trying to restrict the examples we examine to things that\nare clearly human beings. this would make the argument skewed in your\nfavour. let's use the trial example again. it's like saying that the\nonly evidence anyone is allowed to present is evidence that makes the\nsuspect look guilty. (10) think of me as the defence lawyer in that\ntrial. what evidence would i be presenting: evidence that makes my\nclient look innocent, or look guilty? obviously i'm trying to get him\noff the hook, so i will make him look innocent. you, as the crown\nprosecutor, will be trying to make him look guilty. both types of\nevidence have to be allowed at the trial, or else the trial would be\nbiased. now do you see why i'm presenting non-human being examples\nwhile you're presenting human being examples? and do you see why it is\nrelevant for me to present non-human being examples?\n-------------------------------- muddy issue b: murder vs killing\nanother issue that is impeding our debate is the question of whether\nwe're discussing a legal issue, or a moral issue. you claim that i am\narguing about the law, when you're arguing about morality. that is not\nthe case. i'm not arguing about the law. i'm not arguing about whether\nit's legal in this country or that country to have an abortion. and\ni'm not arguing about whether abortion should be legalised or banned.\ni'm arguing over whether or not abortion is allowable by moral\nstandards, just like you are. the only reason \"law\" ever came into\nthis dispute was that you introduced it in. you said, many posts ago:\n\"no matter how you look at it abortion is murder.\" murder is a legal\nterm describing a criminal offence. it means (more or less - the\ndefinition varies by country) the intentional or reckless killing of a\nhuman being. there are three parts to this: (1) it has to be\nintentional or reckless, (2) it has to be a killing and not just\ninjuring, (3) the victim has to be a human being. but i know that you\nraised \"murder\" to make a point about morality, not about law. you\nused the word murder because you think that killing a foetus is a\nmoral violation . the word \"murder\" intrinsically suggests moral\nwrongness. obviously i disagree - i do not think that killing a foetus\nis a moral violation. hence i said that killing a foetus is not\nmurder. i'm not saying this because the laws of some random country\nsays it isn't, but because i think that abortion is not a moral\nviolation . and my argument was that it's not immoral because the\nfoetus doesn't fit into the category of \"human being\", which is one of\nthe requirements for the definition of murder, whether you take it to\nbe a moral term or a legal term. to disallow me from differentiating\nbetween murder (which is morally wrong) and killing (which is not\nalways morally wrong), as you attempted to in your last post, would be\nto say: \"i declare that abortion is morally wrong. now that this is\nfigured out, let's debate about whether or not it's morally wrong.\"\ncompare that to the people at the robbery trial saying: \"i declare\nthat the defendant is guilty. now that this is figured out, let's\ndebate about whether or not he's guilty.\" do you now see how\nridiculous it would be to define abortion as murder, and then not\nallow me to argue that it isn't? i repeat once more: i'm not talking\nabout laws. i'm not talking about what's a crime and what isn't. i'm\nnot talking about who is a legally recognised person and who isn't.\ni'm not talking about who's a citizen and who isn't. i'm talking about\nwhether or not abortion is immoral (morally wrong). and in order to do\nthat, i have to argue that murder and killing are not the same thing.\n-------------------------------- resolved (?) issue: english ability\nif you still think that my english skill portrays me as \"severely\nundereducated\" compared to your skill, please provide further argument\nto that effect. but it appears in your last post that you no longer\nbelieve this, since you replied to my challenges on language without\naccusing me of having very low language ability. if you have changed\nyour mind about one of the claims you made earlier, basic debating\nstandards states that you should retract this claim - i.e. say that\nyou've changed your mind. retracting a claim doesn't mean you've\n\"lost\" the debate. it only means there's one branch of the debate that\nyou don't want to pursue any longer. it also means that you are an\nhonest debater, willing to fully explain what your opinions are at any\npoint of the debate, rather than sweeping inconvenient ones under the\ncarpet. so will you retract the claim that my english ability suggests\na severe lack of education, or will you maintain this claim and\nprovide suitable arguments for it? --------------------------------\nthere are many more points i would make (like the issue of imaginary\nlines, what i think is or isn't personhood, and also the issues that i\nhaven't addressed in your second-to-last post), but i want to leave\nthem for later. i don't want to stuff too many ideas into a single\npost, or they will get mixed up again. so let's figure out whether or\nnot we agree on these three issues. if we do, then i can proceed with\nthe next part of my argument.",
                " \"just being locked up and doing nothing is pointless\" i agree with\nyou fully. but while the penal system is another flawed example of how\nour government works, there are things that are implemented to not\nonly warehouse inmates to sit around, but also to give them\nrehabilitation. they have access to education, some vocational\ntraining, counseling and other mental health services to help make\nsure that when they are reintroduced to society they are not as bad as\nwhen they went in. (this is the theory of course and i understand that\nrecidivism is still higher than necessary, but this i believe is due\nto the lack of support once out of prison regarding economic\ninequality etc, but that is another discussion entirely). they are not\nfor the most part \"living happy lives\" and no of course i do not\nbelieve that criminals are more important than the poor or needy, but\nin many ways they are on the same level. i say this because of many\nfactors such as the rate of incarcerated people having a much higher\nlevel of mental health issues, an unjust law enforcement system that\nis levered against many people in society and a few other reasons that\nlead us down the road you talked about earlier as to the \"why\" they\nare in prison. again, my point is not that they have \"rented\" their\nspace in advance, only that their tax dollars have been collected and\nso portions of their incarceration are already paid for. look at it\nlike this: if person x was 30 when they went to prison, they have\ntheoretically paid taxes (income, sales, etc.) for at least 12 years\n(i am figuring on the age of 18). the prison they went to was built\nwhen they were 20 so for the last 10 years person x has paid into\nhaving the prison built through his tax dollars. it is not\nforeshadowing any intent on committing a crime, it is just a fact that\npart of his collected taxes were spent building a prison. therefore he\nhas already paid into the prison being used. (not trying to complicate\nthe idea presented any further, but it goes back into not having our\npersonal choices on how taxes are spent.) i agree again totally with\nyou that we do not spend enough money on the poor and needy, but you\nsimply cannot force someone into labor simply because of being\nconvicted of a crime. it is not only unlawful but unjust as well. i\ncan predict that your argument will again be to change the laws, but\nthis simply will not work as has been shown before by using \"chain\ngangs\". prison inmates, as i said before, have the opportunity like\nyou mentioned to gain skills and experience in the current system. i\nwould suggest to you that rather than focus on the idea of \"they are\nall bad guys who deserve what they get\" which i believe is at the root\nof your argument, try looking up some of the statistics on what is the\nroot cause of why they are in prison in the first place. you have\nmentioned an interest in this before when discussing the \"why\" of the\ncrime. while i agree that there are a some that are inherently bad by\nchoice, the majority are in the the system due to influences beyond\ntheir control (mental illness, etc) which leads back to the original\nproblem of the death penalty being ineffective, inhumane, and unjust."

                " ok now before i go on to dispute you i want to say that, because you\nstarted thinking thoroughly about what you are saying and your\nargument was pretty straightforward and it seems as though you are\njust trying to clarify, and only bringing up new points when you need\nto. so i'm not going to try to provoke you, since you didnt do that to\nme. ok here we go. i think we both know that isn't what i said, i have\nno idea how informed you are. well it certainly seemed as though\nthat's what you were saying. but maybe you were just trying to see if\ni am in the percentage who does believe that crap. how exactly does it\ndo that? because you assumed that i believed all of those conspiracy\ntheories just because many other americans do. but as you recently\nclarified, even though you said: \"to see how misinformed you are\" you\nare just pointing out that most americans do. do you want me to drag\nup the statisitcs showing how many americans beleived saddam was\nworking with al queda, or was involved in 9/11, or that wmd were\nactually found, they really are quite startling. that wont be\nnecessary. i am not one of the people who believes that. ok, so who do\nyou think is responsible for the greater number of deaths of innocent\ncivilains in afghanistan (i'm not even going to mention iraq, that's\njust too easy), the us or taliban? the taliban are responsible for\nmany civilian deaths, although not as many as we claim, but for 1\nreason only: as you mentioned later in your argument, the taliban have\nthe support of many of the people: \"the taliban are a major political\nforce in afghanistan precisely because they have the support of a\nlarge portion of the population.\" the taliban kill less because they\nhave less to kill. many are on their side, and they are not going to\nkill their own supporters, so they kill the few who oppose them. i'm\nwilling to take seriously everyhting you say, that's why i asked for\nfurther clarification. you seem to think that you are proving\nsomething by labelling the taliban terrorists, if what you are trying\nto say is they are terrorists, i agree, but the real question is, who\nare the bigger terrorists?, the us or the taliban. this is true, and\namerica highly exaggerates how good they are, going around protecting\nthe oppressed around the globe, and i am also aware that most of the\ntime they do more harm than good. we also picture the taliban as much\nworse than they are. but i am trying to say that you say the army is\nnot as bad as you say they are. at least some soldiers are trying to\nhelp, even though they might not be helping so much. in the past they\nhave helped people, as in wwii, but more recently they're kinda\ncrapping things up, but some soldiers really think they're helping,\nbut some are forced to come, as in vietnam. the taliban are a brutal\nfighting force with a corrupt religious ideology that restricts all\nhuman freedoms and subjects women to slavery. their strict\ninterpretation of the sharia has no place in the modern world, but\nthere are number of things that seem to allude you: (1.) the taliban\nare a major politcal force in afghanistan precisely because they have\nthe support of a large portion of the population. (2.) if a foreign\nforce invades your country you have every right to resist them,\nespecially when they are responssible for killing tens of thousands of\nyour country men (3.) us motives in afghanistan, just like in any\nother country they get involved in, have nothing to do with democracy\npromotion, or helping the indigenous population, they are purely\nimperialistic and strategic in nature, anyone who really gives it any\nserious thought, or does some serious investigation, knows this, the\ndays when the us could pull the wool over the eyes of people in the\nwest are well and truly over, let alone in the poor world where so\nmany have suffered due to their inperialistic policies. i understand\nall of this, i was exaggerating when i said you portrayed them as\nangels. (1) just because they have support of a large part of the\nnation, doesn't mean they have the right to oppress the other. but\nthis is none of our business and i'm not saying it makes it right for\nus to invade. (2) i know this. i am saying they shouldn't kill the\npeople in their own country who are against them. (3) i know america\nhas no right to get in their business. as i have said before, the\ngovernment is crap and highly corrupted. they lie and deceive, but the\nthe taliban aren't all right either (in killing their own people)\nthere is no such thing, however i do believe you view the taliban as\nthe bad guys. i was being sarcastic. and yes, i do believe the taliban\nare bad guy, but i never said they are the worse guys. well, from what\nyou have said i can easily infer that you (at the very least) view the\nus army as the lesser of two evils relative to the taliban. well from\nthe view of the oppressed they are good. and im not saying the taliban\nare worse, all they are doing is trying to protect their country. they\nare not doing the wrong thing, they are doing it the wrong way. like\nwhat was in the wikipedia article, they use terrorism to get their\nway. i don't lie, i don't pretend to have all the facts, but i have\nenough to back up what i'm saying. i didnt mean you lie, i meant that\nthe us army is not all a lie like you said good intentions don't mean\nas much as you think in a corrupt system ruled over by people\nconcerned with securing greater dominance in the world at any cost. it\ndoesn't accomplish much, but it means alot. i know accomplishing means\nmore than intention, i already ponted out that the government is\ncorrupt and just using them, so i am just pointing out that every\nsoldier is not evil.",
                " it seems that you are forgetting that the thesis of my first argument\nwas islam is made up of rules, and sanctions for violating those very\nrules, in as much as any society. the fact that human rights are being\nabused is a fault of the government and not the religion. the\nsanctions within islam are human rights violations. women are\nsanctioned by islam to be inferior to men, and there is no tolerance\nfor other beliefs. you either convert to the religion, die, or in some\nrare cases are treated as a second-class citizen known as a dhimmi.\nblasphemy, which encompasses any criticism of the religion, is\npunished by death. this is what sharia is, it is a stone-age set of\nrules for how to conduct society that has draconian punishments for\nthe most innocuous of of behaviours. amputations for theft. death for\napostasy. the government is supposed to be responsible for the abuse\nof human rights and if those rights are not tend to, then it becomes\nthe fault and negligence of the government in their incompetent\nleadership. the government is merely following religious dogma,\nbecause in these cases the state is a theocratic one and the quran\nsupersedes state authority, as defined in the constitutions. what this\nreally means is that imams and clerics run the state from the\nbackground and use barbarous punishments to force their societies into\nprimitive social conditions. islam is not a tolerant or enlightened\nreligion, so it must follow that any state which follows its values\ncan never escape barbarism, but the catch is that due to islam's\nstatus as a religion with god-given laws, and the punishment for\nblasphemy being death, it means that these states can never blame\nislam for gender inequality, or human rights violations. to do so\nwould be like blaming god for his system not working. therefore\nislam's problems are ignored or blamed on something external. if what\nthat father did to his son (which by the way, i do not support) was\nlawful in a country with islamic laws, then why did he had to flee the\ncountry where the crime was committed if according to you, there is\nlittle respect for human rights? was it that he was scared of being\npunished by the laws? because turkey is a secular state, just like the\nunited states, which means that he doesn't have a sharia court and law\nto back him. that's an important point here, turkey is suffering from\nislamic fundamentalism just like the united states has christian\nfundamentalism. both have their own creationists, their own hate-\nmongers. however in turkey one of the big social problems is honour\nkillings. i think the only thing that lets our nation maintain decency\nsometimes is our bitter struggle to defend free speech and our use of\nit to expose and ridicule fundamentalism here. in turkey there doesn't\nseem to be as much of this, and indeed a number of works have been\ncensored there due to muslim sensitivities. if more turkish men and\nwomen were outspoken against islam, they might see a more free society\nthere. i reemphasised on the point that islam is not the only source\nof rules and punishment because the conclusion or thesis of my\nargument is the fact that islam is in as much as any other religion or\nsociety. therefore, my arguments are based on my thesis or conclusion.\nno it isn't. islam is one of the most violent religions on earth. it\nnot only condones but praises religious violence. christianity\ncondones religious violence but is less explicit, and judaism is a\nsevere minority so it has hardly the following to do any damage. which\nis also just a minor point compared to the fact that it was in\nchristian empires that an enlightenment occurred which undermined\nreligious authority and set us on the path for liberal democracies.\nislam hasn't had this outcome. it is hardly changed from centuries ago\nin terms of social reform. the biggest mistake people make is in\nconsidering islam just another religion. the other problem with this\nis that it is a kind of admission that as long as it is a religion,\neverything done in its name may be forgiven. people kill each other\nevery day in the name of islam and just because it is a religion does\nnot mean it deserves a free pass for this. nazism is an ideology and\nmillions died in the name of it. we don't forgive nazism as being\nunblamable for these atrocities. the same is true for communism and\nfascism. we do not forgive these ideologies for the deaths suffered\ndue to their influence on the human mind. why defend islam? billions\nof people are living repressed lifestyles because of it, but it gets a\nfree pass? are you kidding me here? the united states is a secular\nnation but as far as i am aware of, executions in the united states\ntook place as a result of traditional and religious punishment. that\ncan be traced back to the origin of the capital punishment in the\nunited states. you'd better list some examples then. i'm not\nconsidering lynch mobs, by the way, these are illicit murders handled\nby mob justice. we do have laws against cruel and unusual punishment\nbut how many were innocently and brutally executed before those laws\nwere implemented? in case you are forgetting, early executions in the\nunited states were by hanging, burning, drowning, beheading and many\nmore until the supreme court made specific rulings on the\nconsitutionality of the methods of punishment used in capital\npunishment. the eighth amendment was adopted in 1791, as part of our\nbill of rights. how many people are innocently stoned to death every\nweek, burned to death, drowned, buried alive, beheaded, and amputated\nin the middle eastern islamic states? if you tried to change their\nways against such brutal punishments you would be branded as a kafir,\nbecause they are merely following holy law. even if we accept that it\ntook many painful deaths to arrive at lethal injection here, your\nargument resonates most clearly against the islamic states you\nindirectly defend by passing islam off as peaceful.\nhttp://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/ descriptions-execution-methods also,\nhow come the u.s supreme court ruled that it was not unconstitutional\nto execute a man the second time after the electric chair electrocuted\nbut not to the extent of killing him due to a mechanical error but\nordered his execution for the second time? i was under the impression\nthat these rulings were due to legal precedent. you will need to be\nmore specific. in the past, the death penalty was given for the\noffense of rape until the laws were ammended and various appeals were\nfiled with the supreme court. i agree that we do not punish the\nvictims, but in the past, victims of rape were allowed to be\nquestioned about their past sexual history and then that line of\nquestioning was used against the victims by making them appear as\nliars or prostitutes in the minds of the judge or jury. worlds\ndifferent from taking a rape victim and putting them into jail. didnt\nin the past also, homosexuality was a crime. werent people arrested\nand prosecuted for homosexuality as a crime? homosexuality was even\nregarded as a mental disorder and still does according the opinions of\nmany. again, this doesn't support your case because in islamic states\nhomosexuals are executed. they are thanking god whenever they commit\nan act of terrorism but do you think that they are doing it for their\nreligion or their country? do you think that the source of these\nactions are of a political nature and because they express thanks to\ngod for their actions does not mean that islam favors their actions. i\nsuggest you try reading from the horse's mouth. an example is the\nislamist alliance's proclamation in somalia: excerpts below history\nhas shown us that muslims were not able to achieve glory and propagate\ntheir religion except through their unity and holding on to the rope\nof allah; and that muslims have never tasted humiliation of defeat\nexcept when they were divided... this tragedy, however, will not end\nexcept with the unification of muslims on the basis of islam and the\nmethodology of ahlu sunna wal jama\u2019 and not on the basis of secular\nnationalism. we have also agreed upon the following: - working towards\nthe establishment of the islamic caliphate upon the path of the\nprophet. - waging jihad in the cause of allah to accomplish tawheed\nand eradicate polytheism until allah is worshiped alone without\npartners - confrontation of the global zionist-christian crusade and\nits suppression. - application of the shariah of allah and the\nadministration of justice and elimination of injustice. - the\napplication of the ideology of alliance and enmity ( al wala wal bara)\n- restoration of the islamic sanctities and cleansing them from the\njews, christians and apostates - supporting the oppressed and freeing\nthe muslim prisoners - nification of the muslim ummah upon the banner\nof tawheed - creation of a cohesive muslim society that is guided by a\ncorrect ideology, islamic morals and shariah source (more exist, this\nis just a blog that copied and pasted it):\nhttp://occident.blogspot.com/ the point is that these people are\nacting under religious motivations which determine their politics in\nsome way. if that was indeed the case, then how come many muslims and\nthese are not just muslims but strong level of faith belief muslims\ncame out and spoke against the act of many of their other muslims? and\nhow come did the islamic law not prosecute these muslims or muslim\norganisations? in a free society they are allowed to condemn each\nother verbally. in an islamic society they risk violence for blasphemy\nor simply going against the social norms of their area. in islamic\nsocieties the condemnation seems to stem from sectarianism, always the\nsunni and shia against each other, calling each other infidels and\napostates. i agree that we are dealing with a mordern act, so the\ndepartment of homeland security and the fbi unlike the laws were\ncreated in modern society but they also have a different but similar\ndefinition of the term terrorism in that the word terrorism \"is a\npolitically motivated act.\" why did the u.s and the mid east\nencountered a dispute? i do not suspect in the least amount that all\nit takes is for religion to spark a dispute, it is more than religion,\nit has to do with the politics involved in international relations and\ntrade. the difference is a matter of scope. when you have an\nindividual who is engaged in violence, it is a matter of personal\nbeliefs. when you have one mob fighting another, it is sectarianism\n(religion). when you have a nation fighting the other (or nation-wide\nmilitary organisations) it is political. the top-down version is that\nthe leaders of al-qaeda, the taliban and their hundreds of offshoots\nare fighting for purely political reasons (they want to be the future\nleaders of a megastate and see islam as a means to this end) but they\nrecruit people based on religion (these recruits believe that they are\nacting for god) and there are many casual supporters (they just\nbelieve as they were raised to). the religion makes allowances for\nviolence and so it is very easily used to gain supporters for\nparticularly violent movements. imagine trying to do the same thing\nwith buddhists or jainists. how could you convince a population of\nlargely nonviolent conviction that personal offense must lead to\nexecution? how would you gain their support for implementing laws that\ntreat women like slaves? it would be possible but much more difficult.\nwith islam we see ideas and indoctrinated culture that is ripe for\nmanipulation. while i would agree that islam is a religion of peace, i\ndo not agree with the way the government has executed it's functions.\nmy country of origin is also a country where islam is practised, but\nyet the chief prosecutor of my country is a muslim woman and she is\npart of an international islamic organisation. you mean maria bashir?\nshe's been on a hit list for some time. it really shows how much\nmuslim men fear women and their ability to succeed in society. while\nmy country is not built upon islamic laws, women like the one i\npreviously mentioned would be counted as sinners because they are\nsupposed to be the inferior housewife type that is subjected to the\nrules of their male counterparts in islam but unlike what you are\nclaiming, this is not the case. women has always been considered as\nbeing the inferior type but many efforts are being made to change the\nperception of those who would think so. what matters here is that\nislam systematically places women into a role that is little different\nfrom property. oppression of women and homosexuals exists in many\nother societies as well, and not only islamic societies. it has to do\nwith traditions. and as far as i am aware of, every religion counts\nhomosexuality as a sin and expects women to abide by the rules her\nhusbands makes. matriarchies have existed in the past, and societies\nlike the greek and roman empires were very tolerant of homosexuality.\nwhat is important to remember is that a religion is created from the\nlocal culture of origin and then is spread like a virus, taking those\nvalues with it. islam and judaism originated in the middle east and\ntook their views on women from those cultures. they then spread those\nviews across the world. i however do not support the oppression of\nhomosexuals and women, is why i am publishing a paper on these two\nissues highlighting the origin of these issues in the victorian era.\nthey did not originate in that era, however. they have existed for\ncenturies as part of religion, and before those religions as parts of\nancient cultures. islam forbids political activity to be closely\nassociated with religion so if the state is in a political dispute and\nthey provide funding to a terrorist group, it no longer becomes a\nreligious act but a political act of vengeance. try reading inspire\nand jihad recollections. they seem to not care about your theological\ndistinction. to them politics and religion are part of the same thing."

                " i'm looking at the whole thing with a pretty objective lens. your\ntaking single source vilification and buying it hook line and sinker.\nfirst of the reason bush didn't finish off saddam in the first war had\nnothing to do with liking him. the us never really liked saddam. we\nsupported iraq against iran but secretly hoped they'd kill each other\noff as we hated iran only slightly more than iraq. it was a \"the enemy\nof my enemy is my friend\" kind of thing. we were not even selling\nweapons to iraq. they bought their weapons from russia, it was russia\nwho supported saddam and it was russia who battled un sanctions\nagainst him and who delayed the invasion of iraq. it was germany and\nfrance who supplied iraq with the technology to build a reactor and\nthe expertise. the us and iraq have not been close, allied or even\nfriendly at any time in the last 30 years. this idea iraq was somehow\ncontrolled by anybody much less the us has zero merit or logic. even\nthe muslim community could not reign saddam in which is why most\nterrorist groups hated him as much as his people and the west did. he\nwas a loose cannon simple as that. as for chomsky i need read nothing\nbut that name to no that source has no credibility. the man is an\navowed marxist and america hater. if he said the sky was blue i would\nlook for how that advanced his marxist agenda. using chomsky as a\nreference would be like me pointing to some right wing blogger as a\nsource of information. chomsky is essentially a left wing blogger and\nnothing more. your second reference comes from chomsky also. maybe you\nshould ask stalin what a wonderful world russia was while he\nslaughtered millions. hard to tell just how many saddam killed as they\nstill haven't found all of the mass graves. many people were just\nburied. one of saddam's sons was a serial killer. on top of that were\nsaddam's normal murders such as the relatives he lured back from\njordon merely to execute. athletes who did not perform up to\nexpectations and anybody saddam suspected of plotting, disloyalty or\njust plain didn't like. all told it was about a million people total.\nnot counting iraq army casualties who should be laid squarely on\nsaddam's shoulders as he provoked the war, left his troops in\nimpossible to defend situations and had no regard for their lives.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_rights_in_saddam_hussein's_iraq has\na pretty reasonable accounting of the atrocities. like all wikipedia\npages you have to double check facts on it but overall this one seemed\nfairly unbiased and gave a pretty objective account. i'll admit that\nthe 2 years before the war part was as big an exaggeration as your\ndeath toll figures. the million dead at saddam's hands were over his\nentire regime with hundreds of thousands killed in reprisal for\nuprisings in 91. as for why bush sr stopped that is simple. the man\nhad no political courage. he took an easy victory and fearing that his\nallies would dessert him and that people in the us would protest the\nwar if we suffered any casualties bush tucked his tail between his\nlegs and rejoiced his great victory. it was one of the most shameful\nthings in us history. bush promised iraqis he'd support them if they\nrebelled and he left them to die !!! there's no mystical conspiracy\nthat caused this. it was idiots like chomsky who were screaming about\nhow the whole war was for oil that scared bush into leaving the war\nunfinished. chomsky deserves every bit as much blame as bush sr for\nthe 2nd iraq war. a large percentage of those killed in iraq after the\nus invasion were former iraq gov officials and soldiers. many at the\nhands of relatives of people they tortured to death. many in militias\nbattling us and iraqi troops. there were many civilians killed in\niraq. the majority killed by bombs targeting innocents. americans were\nnot setting off those bombs. in fact americans risked their lives\ndestroying those bombs when they were discovered. yes there were\nincidents where iraqis were accidentally killed by us troops and\nprobably a few where it was intentional. it's war. the iraqi army\nkilled a dozen kuwaiti civilians for every iraqi harmed by us soldiers\nwho was no wielding a weapon or running a roadblock or otherwise could\nrealistically be considered a threat. it's impossible to bring a\nmilitary into cities and not have casualties. it's going to happen.\nmany of the casualties were the result of idiotic tactics. we had no\nbusiness replacing the iraqi army and police. the us military is\npoorly equipped and trained to be a police force anywhere much less in\na nation who's culture we had no understanding of. so some of the\ndeaths were purely misunderstandings. i strongly disagree with the\ndecision for us to stay once elections were held and saddam executed.\nafter that we had no business in iraq. would that have prevented the\nsectarian violence? no it would not. the sunnis oppressed the kurds\nand shiites and with saddam gone the shiites took advantage to get\nrevenge. the sunnis responded in kind and the two sides killed quite a\nfew of each other before the violence settled down. if saddam and his\ntwo sons had been blown up in an accident the violence would have been\nfar worse and 4 or 5 million iraqis would have died in sectarian\nviolence. the only thing that kept them from killing each other was a\ncommon hatred and fear of saddam. you act like american troops rolled\nthrough the streets killing any iraqi they could find. that kind of\nthing never happened. most civillians who died who were not killed by\niraqis and who were not holding weapons or running roadblocks were\nkilled when a militia opened up on us troops and a stray round hit\nsomebody by accident. what do you expect if you start shooting at well\narmed soldiers in the middle of a crowded street. iraqis themselves\nshot a number of iraqi citizens by accident in those shoot outs. as\nfor rationalizing. dude wmds can spell the end of all people on earth.\nno iraq had no missile system to deliver a warhead to new york and\nnobody thought they might. however if they nuked israel do you really\nthink israel wouldn't have gone bonkers and nuked half of the middle\neast? do you really want to contemplate living through a nuclear\nwinter wondering not if but how much radioactive fall out will fall\nwith that snow? iraq nukes israel or terrorist who purchased and or\nstole nuclear weapons from iraq nukes israel. israel responds.\npakistan unloads it's nukes at both israel and india. india\nretaliates. that alone is enough radioactive material to disrupt\ncivilization. enough to cause a nuclear winter. that means no food,\nradioactive fall out all over the world and billions of dead world\nwide even if ww iii isn't triggered. even if the us, russia, china, uk\nand france never fire of a single on of their nukes. nukes cannot and\nnever have been a defensive weapon. the only defense against the use\nof nukes is the you kill us we kill you and between us we kill\neverybody defense. iraq, iran, north korea, they cannot use their\nnukes in defense. any nation that has nukes also has the capability to\nknock out all of their air force, all of their anti-missile silos and\ntheir nukes before attacking them. the only possible purpose to have a\nnuke for a nation like iraq or iran is to attack somebody. here are\nsome references to attacks on us aircraft by iraq prior to the\ninvasion of iraq.\nhttp://articles.latimes.com/2001/jul/26/news/mn-26676\nhttp://articles.cnn.com/1998-12- 28/world/\n9812_28_iraq.03_1_surfacetoair-missiles- nofly-missile-\nsite?_s=pm:world http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/ 1480015.stm\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/ 1009636.stm so who is lying\ntoo you? all the world's media including many very liberal sites such\nas cnn and la times to invent attacks on us and uk aircraft and ships\nor did chomsky lie through his teeth too you? oscam's razor says it's\nchomsky that is the liar. as for brutal sanctions. it was saddam who\nmade them brutal. iraq was allowed to sell oil for food. saddam\nconspired with unscrupulous people in the un, sold the oil, pocketed\nthe money and deliberately starved his own people.\nhttp://www.cfr.org/un/ iraq-oil-food-scandal/p7631 if you don't like\nthat one do a google search and find 500 references. sanctions never\nkilled a single iraqi, saddam did however. and again it was the\nrussians not america who sold saddam his weapons. russia who propped\nhim up and supported him. russia who lusted after iraqi oil.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ bombing_of_iraq_(december_ 1998) there\nyou will find details of just how long the conflict had been going.\nthe us didn't wake up one day and say lets invade iraq. bill clinton\nthreatened to invade iraq much of the last few years of his\npresidency. as for blowing up the infrastructure well of course !!!\nthat's the first thing you do when your attacking another country. we\nblew it to smithereens. we sent iraq back to the stone age. what's\nyour point? the very last point we actually agree on. as i said before\nwe had no business embarking on nation building. that was the real\ncorruption. it had nothing to do with oil and everything to do with\nrebuilding contracts. cheney and his cronies got filthy rich stealing\nmoney from the us and iraqi governments by taking contracts that were\noften either poorly completed or never completed at all. invading iraq\nhad nothing to do with money, oil or greed or imperialism or any of\nthat. staying in iraq did. at least the greed part. not that we are\ngood at knowing when our welcome has been worn out. we are still in\nbosnia. what possible gain can we have from being in bosnia?

                " 1. then it's an arbitrary rule you made up and didn't tell anybody.\nit's your own damn fault. can a debate be sparked from a person simply\nstating a stance? if yes, then nothing else is necessary to start a\ndebate. that's it, sorry to disappoint you. 2. if you didn't\nunderstand what i meant and you \"wondered\" what i was getting at, then\nyou should ask for clarification. everyone else grasps this concept,\ni'm sure you could to. 3. then you admit to using uncommon rules,\nespecially uncommon for this site. if you have specific guidelines for\nyour debate then it's your responsibility to outline them ahead of\ntime. it's not my responsibility to guess. i'd disagree that posting\nan argument would be a waste of your time as you may find that once\nit's written down that you yourself find a glaring hole in it. you\nassume i haven't debated this issue copious amounts of times in the\npast. i've written arguments for my stance so many times if there was\nsome glaring whole that could be seen simply by writing it, i would\nhave come across it already. so no, there would still be no point.\nbesides, even if there was something wrong with my arguments, it still\nwouldn't make sense to post several of them before they come up in\ndebate. if there's a problem, naturally whomever takes issue with my\nstance will question me into realizes any flaw, assuming they're\ncompetent. anyway, false. taxation is one of the fund raising options\navailable to a government. other options include issuing treasury\nbonds, exporting resources or invading a neighbor and selling all of\ntheir resources. i'm sure you can think of many more options. could\nthe u.s. army sustain itself based solely on the funds it extracts\nfrom iraq? of course they can't, that's just stupid. every government\nknows without a tax base they have no power. it takes 2 tings to run a\ngovernment. 1. coercion 2. public belief in the states virtue it takes\nboth, just one will cause you to grow less and collapse sooner. every\n(half-competent) successful politician since the dawn of politicians\nhas known this. false. no part of using taxation as a fund raising\nmethod then limits the use of those funds to providing monopolized\nservices. the funds may be used to provide services which are not\nmonopolized and non-government alternatives are available, they could\nbe used to build a new palace for a king, or they could be used to\nfind families for all of the orphans in the nation. this is just an\nimmature point to make. o.k., so the government can also use the money\nto keep themselves fat and well accommodated. i'll give you that but,\nthat's more a point for my stance, not yours. xd and yes, the ever\ngracious government allows some \"competition\" to some of it's\nservices, but this \"competition\" is just an illusion as payment for\ngovernment services are mandatory. even if you don't want to use it\nand you want to use a non-state service, you'll have to pay both. most\npeople just aren't in that situation, or even willing. it is in this\nway that government can both have it's monopoly and seem like good\nguys by offering us a choice . wrong. if people chose goods and\nservices because they are optimal then advertising campaigns would not\nbe as helpful as they are to the bottom line. there's a little more to\nwhy people choose the things they choose than mere optimality. you're\nvery quick to say wrong on these points. i'm beginning to think you're\nreading my comment with the mind-set it's wrong and just making up\nreasons that fit your belief. when was the last time you saw a\ncommercial advertising a government service? they don't need to fork\nout the cash to advertise, they have a mandatory payment system. how\ndo you think a company acquires the money to mass advertise? either\nthey lobby the state to for \"regulations\" that make it harder for new\ncompanies to grow, or they offer such a damn good product/service that\npeople willingly pay them enough for them to advertise. without\ngovernment, only the later is possible. i mean, it's like you didn't\neven bother with a simple thought experiment before you made this\npoint. =/ also, i'm wondering what regime you're referring to. i'm not\nsure when the last time a person was sentenced to death for not paying\ntaxes. it hasn't happened in the u.s. as far as i know, but all that\nproves is that no one pushed the state that far, not that the state\nwouldn't do it. think about it, if you don't pay your taxes what\nhappens? well, you get a letter, then another letter, maybe a couple\nmore. then they send someone to collect it, if you still refuse they\nsend a court notice. if you don't show they get police to come kidnap\nyou. and if you still refuse to pay they will either have to kill you\nor somehow manage to throw you in prison. even then, your only\nincentive to not break out of prison is that they will kill you. all\nthe letters and court rulings in the world mean nothing if they wont\nkill you in the end. usually the government only has to go as far as\nextracting the funds from your bank account since most people value\ntheir lives enough to live under the governments rule. finally, it is\ntrue that taxes are legally compelled but that's no different to you\ncompelling someone to pay rent. not true. rent is a completely\nvoluntary system. you agree on a price when you move in, if you don't\nwant to live there anymore you can leave. taxation is something you\n\"owe\" the government for just existing on land they claim, even though\nmost of it is vastly unused. you aren't allowed to opt out of\ngovernment services. you must pay them. and there is no agreeing on\n\"price\", you pay what they want you to pay. the land lord offers you a\nhome. the government didn't build my home, but they still want my\nmoney. you're land lord doesn't take extra money off your salary and\ncharge you extra for everything you purchase. there are few things\nless similar. the premises have been disposed of so the conclusion\nstands unsupported. however, 'optimal' has yet to be defined. no it\nhasn't. by \"optimal\" i just mean \"better than any other company is\ndoing\". this statement does not follow from the preceding argument\ngiven. it's function here is to create the sense that the preceding\nargument is somehow relevant to the main question by equivocating on\nthe word \"corruption\". to clarify, corruption here means political\ncorruption which is \"the use of legislated powers by government\nofficials for illegitimate private gain\". refer to\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ corruption_(political) ) ) for further\nclarification. i love how you always seem to bring things up after the\nfact, but still act as though it's something i should have just\n\"known\". xd i was using the word corruption as it is in the dictionary\nbecause all you said was \"corruption\". now you mean \"political\ncorruption\"? i said what i said as a summary of everything i said\nprevious. it was a \"bottom-line\" kind of deal. you say you want to\nknow if a government can exist free of corruption, i say it's very\nstructure is one of corruption, therefore it cannot exist free of\ncorruption. government is set up by corrupt, for the corrupt. it's\nstructure is based on power over the common man by monopolizing all\nthe most necessary services an making payment mandatory. further\ncorruption is only a given as this set-up will attract all the most\ngreedy and power-hungry people. a society doesn't need a government to\nsustain itself and it works better without one. the only reason for\ngovernment is to support the lifestyle of the politicians. for that to\nwork, they have to convince the population that they need the\ngovernment either by creating problems only the government can solve\nor teach the next generation about the validity of the state by\nsetting up government education camps and making attendance mandatory\nfor 12 years. is that corrupt enough for you, or do you still think\nfurther corruption is necessary for you to finally view the state as\nillegitimate?"

issues to make the political\ncost of not voting for this bill higher. in other words if the house\nreps or the blue dog dems don't vote for this bill when next\npresented, they will be accused of voting against hurricane relief for\nthose hurt by ike. this is exactly what i said i didn\"t want to see\nhappen. muddying the waters of this bill for political reasons so that\nif the bill sucks, it still goes through for all the wrong reasons. 2.\nmy example of a gotcha question was asking palin what she thought of\nthe bush doctrine. i say this because gibson had to know that there\nare several issues that have been referred to as the bush doctrine and\nwhen asked to clarify the question, he declined to explain. if he\nreally wanted to know what she thought about preemptive attacks, or\nthe axis of evil, or intent to destroy global terrorism organizations,\nhe could have explained what he wanted her commentary on. instead he\nplayed gotcha with the question by insisting she respond to the \"bush\ndoctrine\". i say he did this knowingly because gibson had previously\ndescribed it one way and that night after she answered his pseudo\nquestion as best she could, he gave a different definition of the bush\ndoctrine. a gotcha question is one where you don't really want the\nanswer, you want a flub you can make hay off of. either for partisan\nreasons or just because it is good for ratings. this is why when i\nwatch the debate, i do not want tmz moments. i want to know what they\nreally think. i already know that palin is weakest of the 4 on foreign\npolicy. no shame in that. so why hit us over the head with it? let her\ndemonstrate what she does know instead of making a gotcha moment. i\nknow biden. i don't need to hear him. i want to hear her. i want to\nsee if she can beat the odds and hold her own. but we know darn well\nshe will be given scant chance to show us her self. everyone wants to\nsee her flop. letterman and leno want it. gloria steinem and rosie\nodonnell want it. biden and obama want it. the network wants it. i\nlike gwen ifill from back in the days when she was local here in dc\nand think she is good at her job and scrupulously fair, but now her\nbook deal gives us reason to think even the moderator wants it of all\nsilliness. 3. i do believe they were this powerful for three reasons.\nfirst they were long timers and power in congress does accumulate with\nlongevity; in the vernacular, they know where the bodies are buried.\nsecond, and related, part of power increasing with longevity is key\ncommittee assignments and these guys held the key committee posts\nregarding fannie, freddie and the specifics of most of what we are\ntalking about, and last neither side has had the 60% necessary to\noverride a veto in ages so having the majority has a lot of import but\nnot enough to cram something through. either side with enough of its\nmembers standing firm can kill any bill even from the minority\nposition. so even when the repubs ruled the pres, the senate and the\nhouse, the dems could block their attempts to regulate the gses\n(fannie and freddie). i believe the three of them were this powerful\nbut don't forget, power in the congress comes from getting your\nbuddies to vote with you. the congressional black caucus for one group\nof \"buddies\" were unanimous in backing their attempts to protect the\ngses. this was natural because it helped much of their specific\nconstituencies. so while any one of those guys is only so powerful, he\nbrings certain alliances with him. i am no congressman. i like\npolitics but hate the limelight. i don't have that kind of money or\nambition. when i was building low income houses, jack kemp was\nsecretary of hud. we worked together on what i was doing and i\nsupported (euphemism for gave and raised money) for him. later when he\nhad his \"think tank\" empower america, i went to him with a couple\nideas i had, the ones i described in that post and one other. he\nbasically patted me on the head and told me to run along but he did\ngive me a couple contacts and they pretty much went nowhere in terms\nof getting a congressman to sponsor it as an actual bill. sorry if i\ngave the impression of something of more importance. but like the\nmoney losing low income homebuilding, i loved every minute of it. the\nthird idea has been implemented by a friend and i have written studies\non it trying to drum up more interest but so far it is a hobby/dream\nthat won't grow into more, no matter how good an idea \"i\" think it is.\nwhat i said about bush &amp; mccain is that in 2004 and 2005,\ngreenspan had been hammering the freddie/fannie issues and the\nadministration started beating the drum on this. not only for\naltruistic reasons. it was no secret that acorn/mac/mae were funneling\nhuge money into democratic party campaigns. so while in retrospect\nthey were right on fiscal, moral and legal grounds as well, it didn't\nhurt that they were going after big dem money. it would be like today\ndoing the right thing and oh, by the way, taking down george soros. so\nthe administration went after more, not less regulations for the gses\nand attacked franklin raines. mccain was a part of that effort when\nthe senate set up the hearings under chris shay. if i said obama was\nin favor of deregulation, i misspoke. i think i said somewhere that\nobama was blaming the current problem on republican efforts to\nderegulate wall street. at that point i agreed with you that\nrepublicans generally favor deregulation but in the narrow scope of\nthe gses which i believe are at the heart of this problem, when the\nrepublican administration and legislators tried to regulate them to\navoid exactly what we are now going through, it was the dems who\nfought it. so that single instance was a reversal of normal roles, yes\ni agree with that. at the bottom of one of the posts i made today on\nthis thread/argument is a link to some video of republicans\n(specifically chris shays who led the hearing) pushing for regulation\nof the gses and of many dems (including frank and several prominent\nmembers of the congressional black caucus indignant that anyone would\nwant more regulation of the gses which had no fiscal probs and were\ndoing such a good job. interesting is that one of the guys seen in\nthere, a young rep from alabama has recently apologized for being\nblind to the problems, much to his credit. i understand completely the\nresistance to privatizing social security. i am for it for a couple\nreasons. inflation is usually 2 to 3 percent. social security averages\na 1.5% return on your \"investment\". so instead of making sure no one\nloses, it guarantees that everyone loses. i would not want anyone to\nhave choices in the privatization. i agree that not everyone can\ninvest successfully . . . not because they aren't smart enough but\nbecause most of us don't have the discipline it takes to resist our\nwrong headed instincts. stocks are the only thing i can think of that\nthe average person refuses to buy on sale and cant buy enough of when\nit is marked up to a premium. the only people who are losing money in\nthe current market are those who have to sell to live now. if you are\ninvesting in your ira, you are now buying twice as many shares of the\nsame stocks as you were 6 months ago. since you are going to sell it\nin when you retire in say 20 years (my target date as i am 50), the\nprice you sell it at will be the same for the one share you bought 6\nmonths ago as for the 2 shares you bought today. if you are retiring\nin a year or so, you may get hurt. but if you have been investing in\nyour ira or your 401k for 30 years, you are still ahead more than\nsocial security's 1.5% return. just not as far ahead as you were 6\nmonths ago. does that make sense? you don't have to be smart to get\nthis . . . just brave! you have to keep sending in your monthly check\nto your ira as the market is crashing all around you. i suggest\nlooking at the number of shares you are buying, keep diversifying and\ndon't look at the balance because in the 20 years between now and when\ni sell it, it will be up, it will be down, sometimes it will go\nsideways. but the more shares i have, the more i will have to sell at\nwhatever the price is on retirement day. so down 777 points on the dow\nis like going on sale for 8% less than the day before (rounded). i\nwill say that if the market had gone down 666 points instead of 777 .\n. . i might have rethought my position on a lot of things! lil briefly\nback to privatization. my biggest objection to it is this. i don't\nwant the govt dumping huge amounts of social security dollars into the\nmarket. someone is gonna get rich and it wont be me. but this 700b\nbill is a unique opportunity. think of it this way. we already (the\ncollective we, the taxpayers) took warrants and stock from companies\nwe have helped out already. we are talking about taking on another big\nbunch of assets. let's say we have a trillion dollars worth of assets\nin exchange for deals already made plus the new 700b. lets say we give\nthat trillion in assets to the social security trust fund. the trust\nfund now has assets. next month you pay, as you do every month 77\ndollars in social security premiums (made up number). this time,\ninstead of giving the $77 to the general fund as usual and the general\nfund sending an iou to the social security trust fund, your social\nsecurity account gets a credit or claim of $27 against the assets\nrepresented by that trillion dollars worth of warrants, mortgages,\nhomes etc. the other $50 gets handled as usual. so you have your\nsafety net of $50 plus $27 of more risky but potentially more\nprofitable holdings. the govt is going to hold those assets anyway so\nthe taxpayers are assuming the risk anyway. the 700b would be used to\ndo exactly what it is going to do anyway but the assets would be held\nin social security. the govt doesn't have to dump a trillion dollars\ninto the stock/bond market and the growing deficit in the social\nsecurity books either shrinks or grows slower. i have no doubt there\narea million reasons why this wont work. reasons i cant imagine never\nmind think of. but this kind of drastic move is what i want now.\nnormally i don't want to let a ron paul remake our country all at\nonce. whiplash would kill us even if he was absolutely 100% correct.\nbut in the crisis mode we are in, i want bold action to fix things,\nnot to bandaid a hemorrhage. now is the time, as the other\nthread/argument said to be valiant!",

                " rich fat cats can only become and remain rich fat cats as long as the\npeople allow them to be... since when? lower class people rely on\neverything from big companies. people can't simply boycott big\ncompanies like you suggest. big companies control the jobs of the\nlittler people and the essential living expenses of littler people\n(food, clothing, health-care, shelter, etc). so no, they cannot simply\nstop buying things from bigger companies and the fat cats that run\nthem. the only time this is possible is when a ton of people can\nboycott a single huge company that does not effect them ... which is\nan impossible scenario when the only company that oppresses you and\nyour family is the one you work for so you can eat. the founders never\nwanted social security or a welfare system... don't spout that crap.\nthe founding fathers were old men that lived hundreds of years ago. it\ndoesn't matter what they've said or done according to history books:\nthey're human. you are human. therefore, you don't know what they\ntruly thought, felt, and believed as individuals. they could have all\nbeen gay for all you or anyone knows! so don't talk as if you can\nspeak for their beliefs, because you can't. and carbon in the\natmosphere is not going to destroy the world... support this. real\nscientists can support the fact that, continuing like we have with\npollution, the earth's climate-change cycle could possibly accelerate\nthousands of years too early and put us into a new ice/warm age within\na few hundred years. or less. a man getting married to another man, or\na woman getting married to another woman is a choice. being born a\nnegro is not... tell me, was being born heterosexual a choice? no.\nneither is being born gay. don't give that crap. just as black people\nwere lynched and beaten and harassed in the 60s, so are gays. the only\ndifference is that because of the civil rights movement of the 60s,\nbigots know when the shut their damn mouths when an oppressed people\nbegin having rallies and parades, like in the 60s. they're smarter\nthen that. they know if they shut up and keep their opinions to\neveryone but their children, they'll be able to get their way over\npeople they hate over a long period of time. thus,\nracism/sexism/bigotry continues to leak into seats of power after\nthousands of years. point: you're wrong; gays are oppressed and there\nare tons of people who care about oppressing them out of\nmaliciousness. why does anyone care about this? why do people care?\nbecause we, the united states of america, killers and oppressors of\nentire races and religions and countries, totally need modern\ncountries to hate us more! the power of the president has also\nexpanded drastically since the days of the founders... oh yes, it has,\ndefinitely. the expansion of power has also allowed democratic\npresidents like george w. bush to sign things like the patriot act. oh\nwait... hypocrite i think it would be fairly difficult for any outside\nforce to destroy the us, but that's also considering that we continue\nto spend hundreds of billions of dollars on defense oh look, something\nwe agree on. already happening and being observed. just ask any\nbusiness owner why they aren't expanding their company. most will tell\nyou it's because of taxation and over-regulation and you believe them?\nwell, don't. their ability to create jobs has nothing to do with\ntaxes. saying it's because of taxes is them being lying bastards who\nwant their republican side-kicks to kick democrats out who're fighting\nthem so their side-kicks will remove restrictions put on them by\ndemocrats so that they may cheat the economy, like the robber-barons\nand monopolies did years ago before democrats beat their punk asses\ninto the dust so that hundreds of people would stop dying every day\nfrom starvation and unsafe factories, and also so that hundreds of\npeople would stop going poor every day from the non-existent minimum\nwage and non-existent unemployment benefits. the only regulations\ndemocrats have ever put on big business was to stop them from\nenslaving and killing people. if they did something stupid with their\ncompany stocks or if they played the market like a game, which all\ncompanies do at least once, and lost a bunch of cash or productivity\nor income, it's their own damn fault. it's never the fault of taxes,\nor their employees. it always theirs. also, out of all the taxes paid\nthe last year, big businesses has paid exactly 0% of it because of\nrepublicans lowering taxes for them. have a nice day. an additional\nconcern of the republicans is the fact that the us debt is now past\n$14 trillion and that eventually this will cause a financial\ncollapse... most of which was caused by the war in iraq and hurricane\nkatrina. katrina was not bush's fault, i will not say it was, but the\nwar was, and he could have handled both situations far more fiscally\nsound. but he didn't. because he was a c average moron that the\nrepublican supreme court put into power. hurp-a-derp. that means\nwhatever politician does this will be committing political suicide\nbecause no one will ever vote for him again really now? what about\nraising that 0% tax on the rich to, oh i don't know... something like,\n5%? 10%? 15%? don't let those faggots fool you. they're rich because\nthey're rich. they have enough money to pay taxes and slowly get us\nout of this mess, which they caused a great deal of. what's the worst\nthat could happen? they have to live like lower-upper class citizens\nlike warren buffet and every successful lawyer/dentist/athlete? would\ndoing that to a big businessman kill the president's political career?\ngimme a break here."

can you\nplease define that concept please? where does the left start and stop\nexactly. obama said he was against gay marriage just before he got\nelected. he knew that being pro gay marriage might cost him the\nelection, so he pretended to be against it. phony! as i explained in\nnumerous paragraphs in my response one elected official does not\nrepresent the left. what obama said and did is irrelevant. we did not\nelect him spokesperson for anyone who is left of center. yeah obama\nmade a cheap political calculation, and? you are the party that\nbelieves gay people should have no marriage rights and you personally\nbelieve they should be put in camps and reeducated. so for you to take\nthe highground over the left on gay marriage is adorable. sure he made\na hacky political calculation, hes a politician, they do that. but he\nultimately ended up legislating in a pro lgbt way so youre not really\nmaking a strong point. he instantly changed his toon after getting\nelected. that's not progress, that's a deceptive politician. youre\nentirely twisting what i meant. i specifically explained that its\nunfair to blame the party or the \"left\" as you call them for what\nobama did. as i explained above yes he made a cheap political\ncalculation. i am agreeing with you. i never said that was progress.\nprogress would be moving from the democratic party of 1950 which was\nanti gay marriage to 2019 where lgbt rights are a significant part of\nits social platform. progress is longterm. these same lying democrats\nhave told us time and time again how their goals are not to take our\nguns. the same way that obama lied about gay marriage, they lie about\ntheir true goals of taking our guns. obama didnt have anything to do\nwith gay marriage being implemented you know that right? and youre\nacting like his support of gay marriage comes out of nowhere suddenly\nafter hes elected. it really didnt. he didnt openly support same sex\nmarriage until 2012 after joe biden announced his support for it.\nprior to that he made several changes like repealing dont ask dont\ntell and reaffirming support and rights for civil unions. youre acting\nlike obama was totally anti gay and then the day he got elected he\nsaid \"mwahahaha i was secretly pro gay all along!\". he was quite\nclearly pro lgbt rights and civil unions and it took over 4 years and\nmany other people around him coming out in support for him to change\nhis mind. he wasnt one of the first democrats to support it he was\nactually quite late to that. your entire framing of obama and the gay\nmarriage stance is a joke frankly. when the time is right, they will\ncome out of the closet as with every other phony stance. they are\ncoming out of the closet once more while people like you insult us for\ntelling the truth! i insult you for the laughably and easily\ndemonstrably wrong things you say. like, it takes half a second of\nthinking critically or searching on google to prove most of what you\nsay entirely false. that is why you get insulted. you hold laughably\nwrong beliefs about the world around you. your beliefs are driven by\npartisan outrage and paranoia which drives you to abandon occams razer\nand see conspiracies where there are none. some of the democrat\npresidential candidates are already telling us they want to take our\nsemi automatic hunting rifles. and there are others on the same exact\ndebate stage that openly disagree with that position. the left is not\na monolith. you say it is simply changing times. i say hogwash! they\nknow exactly what they stand for but refuse to be honest with the\npeople. well you're wrong so idk what to tell you. if youre going to\nsay that politicians lie and withhold information then yes of course\nmany of them do. that isnt a thing that's exclusive to the left. but\nif you're going to say its hypocritical that 30 years ago the\ndemocrats were against gay marriage and today theyre not then thats\njust dumb. thats the distinction im making it is not called progress\nwhen politicians lie to the people. it's called corruption! see above.\nalso question, do you think its corruption to take large contributions\nfrom special interests like military equipment manufacturers, oil\ncompanies, and pharmaceutical corporations? serious question. you have\ngot to be kidding me when you sit there still denying how the vast\nvast majority of democrats support no restriction abortions every time\nthey elect those who tell us they will keep it legal. give me a break!\n\"no restriction abortion\" was from one bill in one state and i dont\nknow if you were paying attention but it got widely slammed by a good\nsegment of the left. why would you expect to understand what liberals\nand democrats talk about when you only visit right wing websites? it\nis not just a few democrat politicians who support this inhumanity!\nhttps://ballotpedia.org/abortion regulations by_state yes it is. the\nvast majority of blue states have abortion restrictions well before\nviability and have zero bills up for debate to change that. you are\nentirely making up this mass-unified support for no-restriction\nabortion. there is no consensus among the party officials and there is\nabsolutely zero consensus of any kind among the democratic voter base.\ni have yet to speak to one person on the left to any degree who\nsupports such a concept. i know its anecdotal but ffs youre deluded on\nthis point. almost the entire democrat congress supports killing\nviable babies for any reason! yeah not even remotely close when you\nelect them, you might as well be killing those viable babies yourself.\nso if all i care about is trade and i vote for a democrat but they\nhappen to do some abortion stuff i didnt support thats my fault?\nthat's dumb. by that logic your support of bush was you killing iraqi\ncivilians yourself. try being honest whith what you support just once\nin your denying life. irony",
                " this is what creates frustration and anger when debating liberals.\nwhen we dont fit into your cookie cutter fox news prepackaged liberal\nbox? when we stop you mid script to explain how youre misrepresenting\nour views and telling us what we believe when we dont actually hold\nthose beliefs? how annoying it must be to have to talk to actual\nhumans who dont just let you project your stupid caricature on them.\nmost of you deny supporting these radical liberal positions of the\ndemocrat party, yet you still vote for them! how do you know who i\nvoted for? i literally voted for a several republicans at my state and\nlocal level. you have no idea who the fuck i am or what i believe so\nstop pretending you do. you cry about how youre a conservative victim\nand the big bully liberals are after you, but did you ever stop to\nconsider that you and i could be allies on certain issues? did you\never think that maybe i actually agree with you on some things? maybe\nif you stopped running your mouth for six seconds we could establish\nsome things we agree on and you could actually make an ally instead of\nan enemy for once. you say you do not agree with trans talking with\nour children in public schools, yet you vote for these liberal\ndemocrats who can not make a speech without pandering to their lgbt\nbase. i think gay people should be able to be married and have the\nsame rights as everyone else. i think people who are gay or trans\nshould not be denied things like housing or adoption on the basis of\ntheir identity. that being said i dont like gay or trans media or\nentertainment. i find drag tasteless abhorrent and i dont think it has\nany place around children. i support politicians who support the\nthings i stated above. there is no \"put drag queens in libraries\" bill\nat the federal level. thats more of a town or state issue and so i\nvoted for republican selectmen and such. see how that works? have you\never spoke out to these democrats you vote for and tell them you do\nnot want lgbt groups going into our public schools, talking with our\nimpressionable children? yes actually i have. in anonymous\ncorrespondence. do you ever speak to the vast majority of democrat\ncongressmen who vow to keep no restriction abortions legal? no because\ni really do not care about that issue one way or another. speak out!\ntell them you will no longer vote for them until they stop supporting\nthe deaths of viabe babies for any reason! no. that's your pet issue\nnot mine. do these viable lives mean so little to you that you say\nnothing to the ones you vote to? yes actually. im not religious in any\nway whatsoever. 90% of abortions take place within the first 3 weeks\nof pregnancy. the vast astronomical overwhelming majority of abortions\nare done on clumps of cells that dont have a single working organ let\nalone a brain and a consciousness. none of the fetuses who are aborted\nwill ever exist to have known they were aborted and frankly the\nwoman's bodily autonomy rights would override its own will anyways.\nfor the 1000th time i will repeat these arguments ive already made to\nyou that you never address. the majority of the other 10% of abortions\nare done in emergency situations to save the life of the mother. youre\nmain issue is obsessing over the 1-3% of abortions that happen every\nyear that are late and not for any medically necessary reason. and i\nreally just do not care about the issue whatsoever it's people like\nyou who ignore this new age democrat party's extremism, and continue\nthis political correct nonsense being shoved down the throats of every\namerican. you ignore the republican party launching every large scale\nwar since ww2, 2 of which were for false pretenses and all of which\nwere complete failures that put over 14 trillion on the national debt.\nwhat about that extremism? you cry about \"oh wahhhh a liberal told me\nto say happy holidays instead of merry christmas\" (which nobody\nactually does by the way) and you ignore 200,000 dead civilians\nminimum in iraq. you ignore massive oil and weapon deals with saudi\narabia as we grow closer and closer to the nation with the religion\nthat you hate the most. you honestly think the main threat to this\ncountry's stability is college kids throwing milkshakes for some gay\nrights cause when we have massive attrocities, waste, and corruption\nright in front of your face. honestly take the damn blinders off and\nsee the big picture. yes, there are issues we would agree on, and i\nwould respect you for those issues if you refused to vote for the ones\npushing these issues. so its not enough that i work with you in the\nareas that we do agree, i also have to pledge to not vote or support\nanything you dont agree with. how about no? just be honest and admit\nwhat you would say to me if i voted for an admitted kkk member. you\nwould call me a racist for electing a man who would further his racist\npositions. you would be correct, but when it comes to what you support\nwith your vote, you deny it. i mean yeah but thats a pretty extreme\nexample. like, i dont agree with republicans on most issues but we\nagree on immigration. so youre free to vote for whoever you want and\non the issue of immigration we can agree in a bipartisan way. nobody\nhas to abandon their party or beliefs just to work together on a\nspecific issue. until you are honest with what you support, there can\nbe no intelligent debate. there is no such thing as a perfect\npolitical candidate. there only ends up being 2 people at the end of a\nprimary for the presidential race and you have to pick one. so you\nyourself have undoubtedly voted for someone that you had disagreements\nwith. its impossible to have a political candidate that believes\nexactly what you do on every issue. even trump you have to admit has\nat least one position you disagree with. i care most about healthcare\npolicy, environmental policy, and worker/union rights and wages in a\n21st century economy. so if i agree with a candidate on all of those\nissues but i disagree on their abortion stance im still gonna vote for\nthem. because they have more pros than cons for me. thats how it\nworks. so yeah ive voted for people that i dont entirely agree with.\nit has no bearing on what i actually feel about an issue just like who\nyou voted for has no bearing on how you actually feel about an issue.\nthe candidates we vote for dont speak for us, the represent us. theres\na difference there."

i mean your entire intellectual community has\nbeen trying to disprove the man since he started speaking out but has\nnever caught him out on anything. the man is probably the most the\nassiduous intellectual of the 20th century. again, if you chose to\ndisagree with him fair enough but please dont try to tell me that his\nevidence is anything but factiual, you'll have a better time trying to\nconvince the moon is made of cheese. look if you can send me a link\nproving he lied about i will gladly accept it cause i know it would\nmake headlines in your country. they have wanted to destroy the mans\ncrdibility in wanyway they could since the day he started speaking\nout, so please send it on. again, you describe the barbarity of\nsaddams regime. i agree with all of it. but i get the sense that your\nusing it as a justification for the war. i cant understand how this\nmakes sense to you. your country was a very close ally to saddam (like\nmany other dictators e.g. rafael leonidas molina trujillo, morena\nmanuel antonio noriega, mubarak, saddat, pinochet, the list is\nendless) when he was commiting all his atrocities, and dont try to\ntell me they didnt have full knowledge of it. you see, your country\ndoesnt care what these leaders do to their civilian populations as\nlong as they play by your rules. saddam only became a tyrant when he\nbegan to fight against western interests in kuwait, to dent this is to\ndeny reality. and what about saudi arabia now, its well known how\nrepressive a regime they have buit are they ever portrayed as such in\nyour media. go look up the amnesty international reports on that\ncountry, it makes for some very iteresting reading, you know seeing\nthe kind of regime your country supports.but you see they dont oppose\nus interests but a country like iran does so there the big bad. i'm\nnot trying to stand up for iran, ive been to the country, i know there\nregime isnt perfect but i can tell you now they its alot more free\nthan what is portryaed in western media, and i dont even need to say\nhow much better it is there than saudi aradia. but hey saudi arabia\nare playing by western rules so theres no problem. i dont agree with\nthat assessment of the situation. i think he knew full well what he\nwas doing when they pulled out of the country. i think your giving\nbush sr. (and the cia, and american administration in general) far too\nlittle credit. they were cold and calculated in their decision making\nprocess, they preferred saddam to an actual democratic movement in\nthat country. thats was the key factor in their decision making\nprocess. this is my opinion, you have yours. i obviously cant prove it\nbut i think mine is more grounded in reality.you see i think its much\neasier for you to say he was a wimp and leave it at that. i think it\nwould be alot harder to entertain the thought that your government\ncould be so self interested. i'm sorry but the war was for oil. i\nmean, how can you deny this, do you think that is kuwait's main export\nwas flour that the us would have intervened, do you think if iraq main\nexport was grain you would be there now. look at whats going on in the\nivory coast, you think your country cares about that, they dont sell\noil. it baffles me sometimes how people like you (who is clearly\nintelligient) are able to convince yourselfs of of some of these\nthings. chomsky deserves every bit as much blame as bush, what planet\nare you living on? i dont even know where to begin with that\nstatement. again, this whole paragraoh is a justification for american\nactions. look, i dont consider american people to be bad, that\nincludes your army. we can argue about exactly how many deaths were\ncaused by amercian troops, how many were caused by the iraqi\nresistance, how many were civilians, how many of those killed were\nfrom saddams regime etc. etc. you say, \"its war.\" again, i agree with\nyou completely but its a war you instigated. america had no right to\ninvade, it lied in order to do so and still fail to get the support of\nmost of western europe, therefore it is responsible for all the deaths\nthat followed. it completely destabilsed the country, it casued the\ndeaths of over a million people. you can justify plenty of its actions\nonce it was in the country, the piont is it had and still has no right\nto be there. i agree with you here but unfortunately your government\ndoesnt. its gona stay in that country for a long time to come. those\nbases will be there long after all the ground troops have gone home.\niraq is just too strategically important i.e. its oil, its close\nproximity to iran and the middle east in general. it admit once your\ncountry install a puppet government they probably send most of the\ntroops home but a complete withdrawl (i.e. no american presenc in the\ncountry) is a long long way off yet im afraid. look i know full well\nthat american soldiers dont go driving through the streets killing\niraqis civilians. what im saying is that civilians deaths are\ninevitable due to there presence in the country. from the wikileaks\nreports (please dont try to tell there lies to) its clear that your\nsoldiers dont excercise a huge amount of restraint, even though they\nare a foreign oppressive power who have no right to be in the country,\nand they definietely dont have the best interests of the people at\nheart. the scenario you describe (although realistic) is the product\nof the scare mongering media currently in operation in your country.\niraq clearly had no capability to launch any nukes on isreal and even\nif it did i strongly doubt it would. you give some of thse countries\nfar too little credit, they dont want to be blown into nothing,\nbesdies you cant just use that excuse everytime you want to invade\nsomebody elses country to steal their resources espeically when its a\nlie i.e. iraq had no wmds. i'm sorry, i though you meant the 2nd\nivasion. i apologuise, i know full well that leading up to gulf 1\nsaddam was responsible for a number of attacks i thought you were\nclaiming you were provoked the 2nd time round. by the way no one has\nlied to me, especially not chomsky, do really think if he made such a\nstatement that your media wouldnt have pounced on him. i think your\nhatred of chomsky stems from the fact that you know the facts he\npresents are 100% air tight, and when you see the reality of your\ngovernments actions its much easier to shoot the messenger than to\nacknowledge there truthfulness. i dont deny that saddam could have\nused oil money to support his people, but we but know he wasnt exactly\nthe empathic type. his country was after getting destroyed and now\nsuddenly your country had imposed devastating sanctions on him. i\nthink helping his own people was bottom of his agenda, but the death\nthat it did cause would have been a lot less had you country not\nimposed those sanctions. and yes they did kill iraqis, that link\nproves nothing except that saddam was a brutal self interestd tyrant.\nhere watch this, you can chose to beleive it if you like, im tired of\ntrying to convince people of the veracity of the links i send.let me\njust say this, the info' presented in the documentary is fully backed\nup by mnesty international and who reports but

the brutal sanctions your\ngovernment imposed, they did not prop up his regime, you did. how can\nyou even deny this.yes they sold him weapons but again anyone whos\nserious about the truth knows american is largely responsible for\narming saddam. russia may have lusted after iraqis oil but they didnt\nlead the invasion the first time round and they didnt illegally invade\nthe second time round in order to procure it. i can't beleive you have\nthe guile to shift blame so blatantly when the fatcs are so clear for\nanyone to see. answer me this, do you think your country is guilty of\nany wrong doing. i mean do you seriously think there on the good\nhonest true side of everything. i'm not saying they wokde up one day\nand decided to invade, im saying if iraq didnt have so much oil they\nwould have have ever had any interest in it. thye would have propped\nup saddam, they wouldnt have cared. my piont is that you destroyed\ntheir country. you had no moral right.the destruction you caused is\nnot even calculable, and it will be felt for decades to come. iraq had\nthe most modern infrostructure in the middle east prior to gulf 1.i\nmean dont you feel any sympathy for the death and destruciton you\ncasued and still cause. imagine the situations were reversed. if nyou\ncant see my piont then i dont think theres any piont in responding to\nme. you must be incapable of feeling sympathy for a bewildered people.\nwell at least theres something we can whole heartedly agree on. again,\ni think your only fooling yourself if you think america has\nrelinquished control of that country. the accusations you continually\nmake about chomsky i find absolutely astounding. look i dont want to\ninsult you so please back up what you are saying about the man. show\nme why you think this way, prove him wrong and i promise i will agree\nwith. if you can show me one example of him telling something that\njust isnt true i will acknowledge all the

                " http://factcheck.org/2012/07/ whoppers-of-2012-early-edition/ both\nsides have gone negative. for example, romney never actually put in a\nvote to outlaw all abortion no matter what, this refers to a 2007 law\nthat did not pass of course. however, romney in an interview did state\nhe would support such a bill at the time. of course he changed his\nmind later... then named a vp who has his 2007 position. so not 100%\naccurate but based on something he actually said. in truth romney did\nnot personally kick that guy's wife off of the healthcare she had been\npaying into, this is the impression one commercial gives. however,\nbane, which he was in charge of, did fire her. as the laws were before\nthe affordable care act this would of course lead to the death of\nsomeone with cancer even if they had been paying into it. did romney\ndo it himself? no doubt he'd never heard of the woman. but through him\nit happened. so based on truth but misleading. you'll find the same\ngeneral plot throughout most of the seemingly over the top negative\nads. it's not equivalent though. obama has never supported\ninfanticide. that's just ridiculous but it's an ad that aired... might\nstill be airing. even the death of osama has been brought into it by a\nromney superpac. something you'd think everyone would agree was a\ngreat day for everyone including the president. they are \"swift\nboating\" him in a sense, claiming that obama said he killed osama. he\nnever did. in fact in every speach he never took credit and gave all\ncredit to the military and the american people every single time.\nthere's no proof romney created any jobs at bane, much less 100,000.\nin fact there is quite a bit of evidence bane destroyed more jobs in\nthe u.s. than it made. if it did create net jobs, they were likely\noverseas. the affordable care act is not spiraling us into debt. every\nestimate says it will save the country and individuals money once\ninitial costs are taken care of... which are less then the war in\niraq. america has not lost jobs since obama has been elected. again,\nthe exact opposite, jobs have been created, gdp is up, and while debt\nis up, it is increasing at a slower rate than the previous 8 years and\nis a lower percent of our gdp (the number that really matters). then\nthere are the ads where obama is quoted out of context giving the\nexact opposite meaning than the intent. like romney's first commercial\nwhere the romney quoted obama saying in 2008 \"if we make it about the\neconomy we'll lose.\" - they implied he'd said that this year about\nhimself. in fact he was speaking about the mccain campaign and saying\nthat they had made the calculation that they could not talk about the\neconomy or they would lose to obama. the exact opposite of the intent.\nor the now infamous \"you didn't build that\" quote which even permeated\nthrough cd. of course i've explained to everyone here the obvious,\nthat the \"you didn't build that\" refers to roads, bridges, schools all\nnecessary to build the business. the romney ads (and cd) have and are\nmisrepresenting the intent, saying he was telling business owners they\ndid not build that business. completely false. obama has not raised\ntaxes. and he's only proposed raising taxes on the top 1%, and this\nonly to the same levels they were prior to the bush tax cut. further\nthe innuendos that people are paying more taxes now, and due to obama,\nis also false. this is one of the lowest tax rates in the history of\nthe u.s. so yeah, many of the obama ads have extrapolated further than\nthey can knowingly say is accurate. they haven't outright lied about a\nposition, misquoted, or made up an issue that did not exist, so far\nanyway. romney ads have done all of this.",

have you\never spoke out to these democrats you vote for and tell them you do\nnot want lgbt groups going into our public schools, talking with our\nimpressionable children? yes actually i have. in anonymous\ncorrespondence. do you ever speak to the vast majority of democrat\ncongressmen who vow to keep no restriction abortions legal? no because\ni really do not care about that issue one way or another. speak out!\ntell them you will no longer vote for them until they stop supporting\nthe deaths of viabe babies for any reason! no. that's your pet issue\nnot mine. do these viable lives mean so little to you that you say\nnothing to the ones you vote to? yes actually. im not religious in any\nway whatsoever. 90% of abortions take place within the first 3 weeks\nof pregnancy. the vast astronomical overwhelming majority of abortions\nare done on clumps of cells that dont have a single working organ let\nalone a brain and a consciousness. none of the fetuses who are aborted\nwill ever exist to have known they were aborted and frankly the\nwoman's bodily autonomy rights would override its own will anyways.\nfor the 1000th time i will repeat these arguments ive already made to\nyou that you never address. the majority of the other 10% of abortions\nare done in emergency situations to save the life of the mother. youre\nmain issue is obsessing over the 1-3% of abortions that happen every\nyear that are late and not for any medically necessary reason. and i\nreally just do not care about the issue whatsoever it's people like\nyou who ignore this new age democrat party's extremism, and continue\nthis political correct nonsense being shoved down the throats of every\namerican. you ignore the republican party launching every large scale\nwar since ww2, 2 of which were for false pretenses and all of which\nwere complete failures that put over 14 trillion on the national debt.\nwhat about that extremism? you cry about \"oh wahhhh a liberal told me\nto say happy holidays instead of merry christmas\" (which nobody\nactually does by the way) and you ignore 200,000 dead civilians\nminimum in iraq. you ignore massive oil and weapon deals with saudi\narabia as we grow closer and closer to the nation with the religion\nthat you hate the most. you honestly think the main threat to this\ncountry's stability is college kids throwing milkshakes for some gay\nrights cause when we have massive attrocities, waste, and corruption\nright in front of your face. honestly take the damn blinders off and\nsee the big picture. yes, there are issues we would agree on, and i\nwould respect you for those issues if you refused to vote for the ones\npushing these issues. so its not enough that i work with you in the\nareas that we do agree, i also have to pledge to not vote or support\nanything you dont agree with. how about no? just be honest and admit\nwhat you would say to me if i voted for an admitted kkk member. you\nwould call me a racist for electing a man who would further his racist\npositions. you would be correct, but when it comes to what you support\nwith your vote, you deny it. i mean yeah but thats a pretty extreme\nexample. like, i dont agree with republicans on most issues but we\nagree on immigration. so youre free to vote for whoever you want and\non the issue of immigration we can agree in a bipartisan way. nobody\nhas to abandon their party or beliefs just to work together on a\nspecific issue. until you are honest with what you support, there can\nbe no intelligent debate. there is no such thing as a perfect\npolitical candidate. there only ends up being 2 people at the end of a\nprimary for the presidential race and you have to pick one. so you\nyourself have undoubtedly voted for someone that you had disagreements\nwith. its impossible to have a political candidate that believes\nexactly what you do on every issue. even trump you have to admit has\nat least one position you disagree with. i care most about healthcare\npolicy, environmental policy, and worker/union rights and wages in a\n21st century economy. so if i agree with a candidate on all of those\nissues but i disagree on their abortion stance im still gonna vote for\nthem. because they have more pros than cons for me. thats how it\nworks. so yeah ive voted for people that i dont entirely agree with.\nit has no bearing on what i actually feel about an issue just like who\nyou voted for has no bearing on how you actually feel about an issue.\nthe candidates we vote for dont speak for us, the represent us. theres\na difference there."

evidence doesn't exist- a statement that is\nmutually exclusive with proof staring me in the face.\" no i stated\nthat the kind of irrefutable evidence you're looking for doesnt exist,\nno matter how much searching you do you wont find a recording of obama\ntaking about how little he cares about american service men lives\nbecause if it did exist (not that he'd be stupid enough to ever say\nsuch a thing) it would either be destoryed by a well wisher or it\nwould be in the public domain.but you know this, and still asked me to\nfind such evidence so you could such exactly what you are saying now\nbecause really all you care about is dismissing my pion of view, i\nhonestly thought you were interested in it thats why i provided the\nsources that were not to your liking. \"i am brazilian\" sorry i just\nnaturally assumed, most on this site are. \"i am sorry- but i think you\nhave your american presidents mixed up. obama is the one who killed\nosama. bush jr. is the one who instigated the war.\" i am sorry but\nwhere in what i wrote did i say i was refering to the current\nadministration. heres exactly what i wrote: \"your government\ninstigated an illegal war in iraq that has led to the deaths of\nthousands of american soldiers \" i am terribly sorry but in my mind\nthat cann mean any government as long as its american. now if you want\nto get down to brass tax, obama promised to leave iraq, he has not,\nwhy do you think this is. di you think its in order to help the iraqis\npeople or do you think that sustaining that war is in the corporate\ninterest. \"i managed to find evidence based on economics. if you want\nme to give you some pointers on how to construct an argument against\nmyself, message me and i can help you out\" thanks for the offer but\nill see how i do on my own for the time being. \"i believe you read\nthrough articles. i was intending to emphasize the fact that you have\nno evidence despite your research.\" i know you think i havev no\nevidence but i really do beleive that to be the case, i think the iraq\nis ample evidence, maybe not the obama administration but don't worry\nwait another few weeks and im sure he'll have boots on the ground in\nlibya. thats another war thats going to instigated under false\npretences (saving the people of bengazhi) in order to secure a chunk\noif their oil reserves. \"well, yes, but seeing as i am researching my\narguments, not yours, it would e helpful for you to cite something\" ok\nfair enough:- -the following is two articles by the renowned british\njournalist john pilger on the attempts by

sinister\norganised force of destruction, specifically in the form of al-qaeda,\nis a myth perpetrated by politicians in many countries\u2014and\nparticularly american neo-conservatives\u2014in an

lecture me on vietnam and the gis after you\nclearly had not watched the documentary so please dont try to lecture\nme on any of these topics until you have read or watched the source\nand have criticisms related to it, ok!!! \"are you surprised that\nosama's family places more emphasis on us brutality than the us did?\nand that is not even my choice of words- the subtitle states\" you\ncompletely missing the piont as you just can't wait to jump to the\ndefense of the us, they lied about what went on, are they still lying?\nwho knows. \"and in that vein, there was still a firefight\" did you\nread the article, they met practically no resistance, there was almost\n50 of them, he (bin laden) was unarmed and not fully clothed and was\nshot in th back of his head. \"i will definitely admit that the us\nversion of the story was exaggerated. however, the first person they\nencountered did try to shoot them-which generally makes soldiers less\nlikely to assume the rest of the house is friendly.\" this is just you\nrationalising it to yourself again, the fact is its alot easier to do\nthis than to start asking really probing question like why was i lied\nto, what is the actual truth in this story? no its really not watch\nthe terrik ramandan interview above. \"also- your article from presstv\nis an opinion piece. that generally means it is not 'completely based\non fact', and in fact is in conflict with your source from the\nguardian (a credible source)\" no i really dont think it is an opinoin\npeice, i will admit there is reasonable amount of opinoin in ot but it\nis backed up with credible sources of information. now i dont recall\nyou saying that no article i post should have opinoin in it, every\narticle has opinion to some extent so i find this quite a ridiculous\ncriticism.btw i find the press tv source to be more credible but thats\nme, the guardian were caught distorting the truth of one of the\nwikileaks cables they were given, wikileaks is suing them for it. \"and\ni seem to recall you stating that they assassinated him because he had\ninformation that obama did not want to leak- which i claimed\nridiculous. i was the one who said they killed osama because he was\nshot at (as pulled from the guardian source, conveniently left out of\nyour presstv 'source')\" yes thats it weave your web, i can see right\nthorugh your motivations my friend, oyu're competely transparent,\nyou're not interested in the truth or really disproving me on proper\ngrounds, you just want to discredit me on any grounds that you can as\nyou so vehemently disagree with my position. i made that suggestion\nand i openly admitted in doing so that i was complete speculation, i\ncame to think that after i realised they had assassinated him, once i\nhad i began to think why and that was the only real tangible reason i\ncould come up with, i have since revised this opinion as i beleive\nthis was too complex and i was readin into it too much, the fact is it\nstill may be correct i just dont beleive it to be the most likely of\nthe reasons for killing him anymore. i now think it was more\nsimplistic than that i.e. he was killed soley for the political gain\nassociated with his death. now is that the only thing you find wrong\nwith the press tv source cause really thats quite weak in fairness,\nnone of my sources are going to agree 100% with each other, the fact\nthat you tried to use this against me only shows how desparate you\nare. personally i think the press tv source is more reliable but thats\njust me. \"my point entirely. i think there was little chance of osama\nbeing taken in alive- simply because i would not suspect him of going\ndown peacefully (again: first person encountered open fired, osama had\ntwo guns)\" still trying so desparately to convince yourself of\nsomething that has already been proved false, for fucks sake man just\nadmit it, he was assassinated, they could have easily taken him if\nthey wanted to, they didnt want to, they were told not to. \"actually,\ni am yet to find any news articles discussing peaceful al-qaeda\ninteractions. \"a google news search: 1 result for: al-qaeda \"acts of\npeace\": an article which discussed obama's lack of acts of peace\nagainst al qaeda. that makes 0 articles for peaceful al-qaeda\ninteractions\" this i find absolutelty hilarious, i say: \"the past\ndealings of osama bin laden with the cia would have to be accounted\nfor in the calculation\" and then you tell me that equates to:\n\"discussing peaceful al-qaeda interactions.\" and you tell me that i\nmust find an something showing peaceful al queda ineractions in order\nto show the analysis to be questionable. look, one thing that isnt\nquestionable is the cia involvment with osama bin laden, now there was\nnothing peaceful about it, they were supplying him and the muhjahadin\nwith an arsenal with which to fight the russians, these kinds oif cia\nactivities are invariably in serious breach of international law and\ncause great human suffering that rarely gets reported or even heard\nabout. thats what i thought the reason they killed him for originally\nwas trying to conceal these dealings, and i also think it would have\nto be accounted for in a hypothesis test but thats niether here nor\nthere."

                " guess what. the u.s. does hand out tax id numbers for illegals. they\ndo pay there taxes. here's the info you need for your argument. by the\nway you thought of a very intelligent solution to part of the problem.\nthe only thing is, is that partial solution has been here for decades.\n:) http://roygermano.com/2011/02/28/ do-illegal-immigrants-pay-taxes/\nyes, illegal (undocumented/unauthorized) immigrants generally pay\ntaxes the same way you and i pay them, but without access to most of\nthe benefits that normally come with being a taxpayer. how they pay\nincome tax every time you receive a paycheck, you probably notice that\nsomething is missing. that\u2019s because your employer automatically\nwithholds federal, state, and local income taxes and social security\nand medicare taxes. immigrants also have money automatically deducted\ndirectly from their paychecks \u2014even those who are here illegally. but\nhow? well, the social security administration estimates that 75% of\nundocumented immigrants are actually on formal payrolls and are paid\nby check just like anyone else. they get on the payroll by using fake\nor fraudulent social security numbers or social security numbers of\nthe deceased, which are easily available from counterfeiters for a\ncouple hundred dollars. a growing number of undocumented immigrants\nnow file their income taxes using individual taxpayer identification\nnumbers (itins). itins are issued by the irs for filing purposes only\nand do not provide permission to work. according to the most recent\nestimates, at least 3 million unauthorized immigrants filed income\ntaxes using itins in 2009. (note: the irs does not report undocumented\nimmigrants to the department of homeland security.) sales tax every\ntime you buy something, you pay sales tax. that money goes to state\nand local governments. staying at a hotel or renting a car, you pay\nstate and local taxes. if you fill up your gas tank, you automatically\npay state and federal gasoline taxes. if you buy liquor or cigarettes,\nyou automatically pay various local, state, and federal excise taxes.\nimmigrants\u2014legal and illegal\u2014all buy things, and thus pay these taxes\nas part of their purchase. property tax local governments also collect\nproperty taxes, which are a percentage of the value of one\u2019s home and\nfund services like schools, certain medical services, and police and\nfire stations. immigrants\u2014legal and illegal\u2014pay these taxes directly\nif they own a home, or indirectly if they rent (clearly, landlords\nfactor property taxes into rent). possible overpayment illegal\nimmigrants pay into social security via automatic payroll deductions,\nbut they can never claim social security benefits because they are\nhere illegally and because their social security numbers are fake. in\n2005, it was estimated that undocumented immigrants paid about $7\nbillion per year in social security taxes that they will never be able\nto reclaim. the tax policy center estimates that 78 percent of\namerican households that earned less than $33,000 owed no federal\nincome taxes in 2011. many low-income taxpayers only paid marginal\namounts if they did owe. because of their low income levels, most\nillegal immigrants would naturally fall into either of these\ncategories. many illegal immigrants don\u2019t file, however, because they\nfear deportation. and if they don\u2019t file, they are never refunded\nmoney that was automatically withheld from their paychecks. when a\nrefund is owed but not paid out, that\u2019s free money for the government.\npossible underpayment undocumented immigrants\u2014and immigrants in\ngeneral\u2014are more likely to work in the informal or cash economy\nbecause these types of jobs are often the least desirable, most\nunstable and inconsistent, and lowest paid. informal and cash jobs\ncreate big incentives not to claim cash income\u2014undocumented immigrants\nand citizens alike find these incentives compelling. most waiters and\nbartenders, for example, don\u2019t claim and pay taxes on cash tips (or if\nthey do, it\u2019s usually just a small percentage). the high school\nstudent down the street usually doesn\u2019t pay taxes on money earned from\nmowing your lawn or shoveling your driveway. legally speaking, they\u2019re\nsupposed to claim this income. something important to keep in mind:\nthe incomes of migrants working in the informal economy are generally\nso low\u2014less than $13,000 per year, according a recent ucla study\u2014that\nmost would ultimately be exempt from paying income taxes or have\nextremely low tax liability even if they did file and claim cash\nincome. public benefits as taxpayers, most of us are eligible for an\narray of social safety nets like food stamps and unemployment\ninsurance. the 1996 personal responsibility and work opportunity act\nbarred illegal immigrants from receiving any welfare benefits except\nin medical emergencies. it also barred legal immigrants from\neligibility for welfare benefits during their first 5 years in the\ncountry. so, no, illegal immigrants do not exploit welfare services\nquite simply because they are not eligible to exploit them. in plyler\nv. doe (1982), the supreme court ruled it unconstitutional to deny\nundocumented immigrants k-12 public education. denying education would\nnot only be crippling to the immigrants themselves, but would have\nnegative implications for the rest of society. but regardless, by\ndirectly or indirectly paying property taxes, undocumented immigrants\npay into public education. in general, immigrants benefit from police\nservice, firefighters, national defense, parks, and other public\ngoods. but again, the taxes they pay contribute to paying for these\nservices. fourteen states offer free prenatal and postnatal care to\npregnant women who are the country illegally. some state legislators\njustify these benefits as long-term cost-saving measures, others as\nbeing consistent with pro-life beliefs. low-income women with children\nunder 5 are also eligible for wic benefits regardless of immigration\nstatus. american-born children of undocumented immigrants are eligible\nfor benefits like medicaid and food stamps. but it\u2019s important to\nremember that the recipients of these benefits are children that the\n14th amendment has deemed full citizens of united states. tax credits\nthe treasury inspector general for tax administration estimates that\nunauthorized immigrants received $4.2 billion in child tax credits in\n2010. there is currently no legal mechanism that bans unauthorized\nimmigrants from child tax credit refunds (although they are banned\nfrom refunds related to the earned income tax credit). read more on\nthis issue at factcheck.org and the washington post. are illegal\nimmigrants a drain on the system? there\u2019s no simple answer to this\nquestion because no one knows exactly how many people live and work in\nthe u.s. illegally, exactly where they live, how much they pay in\ntaxes, or the extent to which they benefit from public goods. this\npoint underscores the difficultly of studying illegal immigration: the\npeople involved do not want to be detected. any so-called \u201chard\nnumbers\u201d you see on the costs or contributions of illegal immigrants\nare often little more than guesses based on imperfect estimates of the\nsize and distribution of the illegal population. this is the case with\ntwo widely-cited (and highly unscientific) \u201cstudies\u201d on this topic:\none from the institute for taxation and economic policy and one from\nthe center for immigration studies. it\u2019s important to understand how\ncertain organizations make their guesstimates. guesstimates published\nby anti-immigration organizations like the center for immigration\nstudies, for example, include public services rightfully used by the\namerican-born children in calculating the costs of illegal\nimmigration. at the federal level, some researchers believe that\nundocumented immigrants pay in more than they take out due to large\nand automatic contributions to social security that can never be\nclaimed. figures vary greatly at the state and local levels. areas\nwith higher concentrations of undocumented immigrants, for example,\nspend more educating and providing emergency healthcare to\nundocumented immigrants than areas with lower concentrations. but this\nis not because undocumented immigrants are out to evade taxes and milk\nthe system \u2014as we learned above, most pay sales, property, and income\ntaxes automatically and are ineligible for the vast majority of social\nservices. rather, the reason undocumented immigrants may take out more\nthan they contribute has mostly to do with their status as low wage\nearners. even if they use the same amount of public services as\nwealthier households, low-income households (be they made up of\ncitizens or immigrants) are generally a net drain on public finances\nbecause our progressive system requires them to pay less income tax\nand by virtue of having less purchasing power, they pay less sales and\nproperty tax."

because unless it is god, it is not an absolute baseline, is\nit? how can you be this fucking wilfully stupid just for the sake of\narguing with me? there is no universal baseline on what constitutes\nwealthy and hence there is no absolute wealth. does it compute you\nstupid, language-abusing neo-nazi wank stain?

because you seem to be extremely\nconfused. economic freedom (capitalism) is not that old economic\nslavery (capitalism) forces people to work to create wealth for a\nselect few individuals, and to pay the cost for those individuals when\nit all goes wrong, as we saw illustrated in 2008. you have provided us\nwith no reasoning on why you equate monetary pyramid systems with\nfreedom, and grandiloquent claims such as these require extensive\nproofs. it appears that all you are interested in doing is abusing\nlanguage to create pro-capitalist propaganda which falls apart at the\nfirst hint of scrutiny. it\u2019s cute that you think wealth creation is a\nproduct of evolution it's much cuter that you think wealth is\nobjectively created. it's almost childlike in its naivety. wealth\ndoesn't exist objectively at all, so it is hilarious that you could\nactually be stupid enough to believe something which doesn't\nphysically exist can be created. when banks make profit from risking\nother people's money they \"create\" a series of numbers on a computer\nscreen. the value we give to all forms of wealth is entirely arbitrary\n(i.e. it is decided by us) but you seem to be arguing that there is\nsome sort of invisible, magnificent deity who has a \"baseline\" for\ndeciding how much wealth is worth. it's very amusing because it's just\nso stupid and obviously false. thanks for the essay, but i'm bored of\nreading it now because you are so stupid and dishonest. it makes me\nsick reading your lies if i'm absolutely honest. you twist, warp and\nmanipulate language in any way possible to disguise your glaring\nfallacies and when that fails you just resort to textbook denial. you\nmean while their people starved your people are starving too, so\nhadn't you better get your own house in order before criticising\ndictatorships from seventy years ago? what does that even have to do\nwith who invented satellite technology in the first place? it has\nnothing to do with it, does it? you just ignored my argument\ncompletely, changed the subject and attacked me. well, two can play at\nthat game i'm afraid. here are some facts about poverty in america:-\nus infant mortality rates in 2013 were the highest in the developed\nworld. us inequality levels are far higher than those in most european\ncountries neglected tropical diseases, including zika, are\nincreasingly common in the usa. it has been estimated that 12 million\namericans live with a neglected parasitic infection in terms of access\nto water and sanitation the us ranks 36th in the world. in the oecd\nthe us ranks 35th out of 37 in terms of poverty and inequality.\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/ dec/15/ extreme-poverty-\namerica-un-special- monitor-report so, as you can see, you are the pot\ncalling the kettle black, aren't you?

                " declarationontributionstions their rights as derived from the laws of\nnature, and not as the gift of their chief magistrate.\" thomas\njefferson. jefferson was a brilliant , yet soft spoken man, notorious\nfor his gifted writing skills. when faced with the fate of american,he\nmade some significant decisions that changed the way we regarded our\nmiraculous nation. thomas jefferson had a very compelling vision for\namerica and certainly impacted the way america is seen today. his\nbeliefs on a democratic government, supporting the protections of\nindividual rights; fathering the declaration of independence , and his\nother contributions\u00a0 to america are what make him a likelier suite for\nthe young nation rather than any other candidate. establishing a\ndemocratic government involved allowing all\u00a0 others to have a say in\nhow they were governed. jefferson supported this , as it did not\nrestrict having a voice in the government to only a certain class,\nprimarily the wealthy land owners. in his mind, every man is created\nequally , as dictated in the declaration\u00a0of \u00a0independence. they shall\nall be granted freedoms and rights of the same degree, know as\nunalienable rights.\u00a0 the right to love life and the pursuit of\nhappiness are among them. jefferson proposed a fair and just\ngovernment, swiftly allowing any man of any class to voice their\nopinion. such fervent beliefs of government reflect on jefferson as a\nperson. he was born into a wealthy family of the highest class, and\ndid not allow his back round to cloud his judgment nor define him. he\nstood firm in his thoughts of equality and guaranteed freedoms to any\nman by supporting a democratic government. jefferson also openly\ndisplayed trust among american citizens, by allowing the people to\ngovern themselves, it shows that he sincerely trusts them to uphold a\ngovernment in which they can take pride in, and claim everyone is\npleased with. as it is the case with most political leaders, trust is\nevident; however most mutual citizens , whichever party they extend\ntheir beliefs to gain trust for their desired candidate; trust to\ngovern accordingly with similar beliefs. it is very rarely though does\nthe political leader share this same feeling of trust. this is why\ncandidate, thomas jefferson would be the most successful as a\npotential \u00a0suite for the young nation rather than any other candidate.\ncitizens in favor of jefferson trust him to maintain their simple\nrights and freedoms, and in return, he trusts citizens, to have a\ncapital judgment, and to lead a successful government. when trust\nbecomes mutual, favorable results, especially in a political sys rem,\nflourish.\u00a0 during the time of ratification of the constitution, the\ntwo candidates for america, thomas jefferson and alexander hamilton,\njoined separate parties. jefferson's beliefs favored the anti-\nfederalists, or those who opposed ratification of the constitution,\nwhile hamilton joined the opposite. jefferson feared that by ratifying\nthe constitution, individual rights and liberties may have been taken\naway. he was especially wary, as there was no sort of protection of\nthese rights mentioned in the constitution. jefferson absolutely\nrefused to support it until actions were taken to secure the personal\nrights and liberties \u00a0of american citizens. in 1791, the american bill\nof rights, inspired by thomasa jefferson, and drafted by james\nmadison, was adopted. jefferson worked diligently to secure the rights\nof american citizens, something taken for granted daily. by requesting\nthe bill of rights, he ensured that no power could be taken from those\nwho should govern america, the people. jefferson himself said, \"a bill\nof rights is what the people are entitled to against every government\non earth, general or particular, and what no just government should\nrefuse, or rest on inference.\"\u00a0 america, viewed by modern society, is\nconsidered to be quite diverse \u00a0with a multitude of different\ncultures, ethnicities, and religions. this is partly due to thomas\njefferson. jefferson introduced the idea of religious freedom by\ndrafting the virginia act for establishing religious freedom of 1779.\nhe firmly believed in allowing american citizens the opportunity to\ndecide upon their own religious faith. he considered this a right to\nwhich should be applied to all citizens of america. jefferson created\nfor himself a lasting impact on american culture today through the\nadministration of religious freedom. this opportunity increased the\ndiversity of our country. he felt that religion and state should be\nkept separate for the benefit of a successful country, which would\nlater be pr oven accurate.\u00a0 thomas jefferson accomplished many things\nin life, such as \u00a0writing the declaration of independence. this\ndocument is what created america by formally announcing our separation\nfrom great britain. this document is one of the most famous in\namerican history and was vital to our success asa growing indecent\nnation. the declaration incorporates the way americans regard\nthemselves, as does outline many other areas of significance. the\ndocument not only signifies the pride of finally being able to\naccomplish a nation of independence, but also serves as an expression\nof american identity. that document dictates who we are, as proud and\nfree americans. the constitution, what we continue to govern ourselves\nwith today, embodies certain aspects \u00a0and principles of the\ndeclaration of independence. our entire form of government contains\nsmall inferences of the declaration. without it, america would not be\nthe powerful nation it has evolved into ovejefferson'ss with\njeffersons help. he outlined the fundamental rights to life, liberty,\nand the pursuit of happiness. it is through this document that the\nequality of man is evident. with that simple line alone, any\nindividual person \u00a0now has the opportunities available to any other.\nthis man of brilliant nature created one of the most influential\ndocuments in history. in one document, he outlined anup mostained with\nupmost importance and detail, what americans stand for, why we reside\nas a dignified and independent nation, the basic rights and freedoms\nguaranteed to all american citizens, and so much more. it seems only\nright to claim that the man with the most enduring vision for america,\nis the one who created it, through writing and mind, and defended it\nwith heart and soul. it was through his words written in the ink of\nhis hand, that all americans are proud and free. we operate as more\nthan a whole, perfectly free from any tyrant who deems it fit to strip\naway our liberties, and crush our spirits. \u00a0 \u00a0 when america comes to\nmind, not only do we think of it as a noble, distinguished nation, but\nalso a powerful and expansive country. we also have jefferson to thank\nfor this. through means of the louisiana purchase, he nearly doubled\nthe size of america with a deal among the french leader napoleon\nbonaparte for once the price of 15 million dollars, jefferson gained a\nrespectable piece of land containing the future states of louisiana,\narkansas, missouri, iowa, minnesota, north dakota, south dakota,\nkansas, nebraska, oklahoma, texas, new mexico, colorado, wyoming, and\nmontana. some might argue that this was done in unconstitutional ways\ndue to the fact that buying such a large sum of land was not written\nanywhere in the constitution. this can be easily overcome as the\neffects of purchasing the land were splendid. this deal doubled the\nsize of america, allowed trade to flourish, and made the nation\nstronger and more prosperous as a whole. when faced with a difficult\ndecision, jefferson did what he thought was best for america, and it\ndefinitely paid off. settlers had new opportunities to create a new\nlife and contributed to the success of our country. \u00a0 because thomas\njefferson was born into a wealthy family, you would expect his actions\nand beliefs to reflect on this; however this was not the case.\njefferson craved equality in this new nation. \u00a0he stood for a\ndemocratic government in which all people, regardless of class, had a\nsay in the way they were governed. he did not allow his past or his\nbackground determine his future. jefferson grew to gain his own\ntheories and beliefs, which reflected only on himself as person, not\nwhere he came from. he thought to include everfavored greatly favoured\nequality \u00a0amongst american citizens. with a democratic government, he\nbelieved the people had the ability to make the right choices if they\nbecame aware. he established mutual trust with all of those who\nbelieved in him to lead a successful country. they trusted him to keep\ntheir rights, and liberties, and he trusted them to prosper with their\nown voices in the government. trust is something that is not typically\nfound in politics , but it has arrived in the form of thomas\njefferson. he supported the protection of individual rights, and\nfought until some sort of actions were taken, and invested into the\nconstitution. he is responsible for the diversity of america,\nbeginning religiously with his drafting of the virginia act for\nestablishing religious freedom. he believed in choice and opportunity.\nhe proclaimed the identity of america when he wrote the declaration of\nindependence. jefferson was at the country's side even when it first\nformed. he authored its birth certificate, while outlining american\nexpression in the process. the declaration of independence is how we,\nas americans think of ourselves, and to think that this exceptional\nman helped begin such an idea, is outstanding. he doubled the size of\nthe country which in turn allowed the economy flourish, as well as\nprovide new opportunities of life for settlers. thomas jefferson is\nthe reason america prospered into a large respectable nation. he stood\nby the side of the people and defended us with everything he had. all\nthe while, jefferson never once forgot where he came from, but he did\nnot let it dictate his life either. thomas jefferson, founding father,\nauthor of the declaration of independence, founder of the university\nof virginia, and third president of the united states, discovered\nbalance. he stood by america from infancy, when it first broke away\nfrom britain, is standing by it now, with is lasting effect on the\ncountry, and will forever be by its side. the united\nstatjefferson'sica is jeffersons country, and although scarred, is\nstill, and forever be going strong."

actual truth in this story? no its really not watch\nthe terrik ramandan interview above. \"also- your article from presstv\nis an opinion piece. that generally means it is not 'completely based\non fact', and in fact is in conflict with your source from the\nguardian (a credible source)\" no i really dont think it is an opinoin\npeice, i will admit there is reasonable amount of opinoin in ot but it\nis backed up with credible sources of information. now i dont recall\nyou saying that no article i post should have opinoin in it, every\narticle has opinion to some extent so i find this quite a ridiculous\ncriticism.btw i find the press tv source to be more credible but thats\nme, the guardian were caught distorting the truth of one of the\nwikileaks cables they were given, wikileaks is suing them for it. \"and\ni seem to recall you stating that they assassinated him because he had\ninformation that obama did not want to leak- which i claimed\nridiculous. i was the one who said they killed osama because he was\nshot at (as pulled from the guardian source, conveniently left out of\nyour presstv 'source')\" yes thats it weave your web, i can see right\nthorugh your motivations my friend, oyu're competely transparent,\nyou're not interested in the truth or really disproving me on proper\ngrounds, you just want to discredit me on any grounds that you can as\nyou so vehemently disagree with my position. i made that suggestion\nand i openly admitted in doing so that i was complete speculation, i\ncame to think that after i realised they had assassinated him, once i\nhad i began to think why and that was the only real tangible reason i\ncould come up with, i have since revised this opinion as i beleive\nthis was too complex and i was readin into it too much, the fact is it\nstill may be correct i just dont beleive it to be the most likely of\nthe reasons for killing him anymore. i now think it was more\nsimplistic than that i.e. he was killed soley for the political gain\nassociated with his death. now is that the only thing you find wrong\nwith the press tv source cause really thats quite weak in fairness,\nnone of my sources are going to agree 100% with each other, the fact\nthat you tried to use this against me only shows how desparate you\nare. personally i think the press tv source is more reliable but thats\njust me. \"my point entirely. i think there was little chance of osama\nbeing taken in alive- simply because i would not suspect him of going\ndown peacefully (again: first person encountered open fired, osama had\ntwo guns)\" still trying so desparately to convince yourself of\nsomething that has already been proved false, for fucks sake man just\nadmit it, he was assassinated, they could have easily taken him if\nthey wanted to, they didnt want to, they were told not to. \"actually,\ni am yet to find any news articles discussing peaceful al-qaeda\ninteractions. \"a google news search: 1 result for: al-qaeda \"acts of\npeace\": an article which discussed obama's lack of acts of peace\nagainst al qaeda. that makes 0 articles for peaceful al-qaeda\ninteractions\" this i find absolutelty hilarious, i say: \"the past\ndealings of osama bin laden with the cia would have to be accounted\nfor in the calculation\" and then you tell me that equates to:\n\"discussing peaceful al-qaeda interactions.\" and you tell me that i\nmust find an something showing peaceful al queda ineractions in order\nto show the analysis to be questionable. look, one thing that isnt\nquestionable is the cia involvment with osama bin laden, now there was\nnothing peaceful about it, they were supplying him and the muhjahadin\nwith an arsenal with which to fight the russians, these kinds oif cia\nactivities are invariably in serious breach of international law and\ncause great human suffering that rarely gets reported or even heard\nabout. thats what i thought the reason they killed him for originally\nwas trying to conceal these dealings, and i also think it would have\nto be accounted for in a hypothesis test but thats niether here nor\nthere."

[editor's note: these notes have\nbeen modified slightly after a critic misinterpreted our language.\nverse 193 plainly says that 'fighting' is sanctioned even if the fitna\n'ceases'. this is about religious order, not real persecution.]\"\nhttps://www.thereligionofpeace. com/pages/quran/violence.aspx"

                " the end result of a man being sexually abused and the end result of a\nchild being sexually abused are are the same to you? my argument was\nprimarily against the purported differences between men and women, as\nthat is the original subject matter of the debate which was gender\nviolence and not sexual abuse. i think there is more ground to argue\nthat the physical and psychological damage of abuse towards a child\nwould be different than for adults, but that is a matter of age\ndifference rather than gender. suggesting you're familiar with much\nresearch ... account for the desensitization to physicality that men\nendure ... prefer that men and women are identically physically\ninclined?... very different outcomes in terms of physical abuse i have\nabsolutely no idea what you are trying to say here. what do you mean\nby \"desensitization to physicality\"? i do not see what physical\ninclinations have to do with the matter either. #semantic-confusion\n\"general tendency to value human life more highly than animal life\" -\nthat was exactly my point when calling for change... if the degree of\npunishment is proportionate to the value we place upon a life, then\nyou are arguing that we should value the life and well-being of women\nmore than that of men. i don't understand the connection you're\ndrawing given that these aren't alternatives but 2 separate dynamics\naltogether. my point was that we do not find violence against animals\nto be as heinous as violence against a human being because of the\ndifference in physical strength but because of the value we view each\nas having. if someone abused a tiger (arguably the more powerful\ncreature) it would still be considered less heinous than if they\nabused a human being. self-species preference; nothing to do with\nstrength. i feel a misunderstanding occurred, i was commenting on your\nstatement that only 2 categories need to be addressed. potential for\nrecidivism (whatever the gender) must be considered. potential harm to\nthemselves can also be a factor in punishment. ah, i see now. other\nthings do factor into consideration, but in that comment i was\nharkening back to the debate topic which sought a definition of a hate\ncrime. definitionally the factors that matter are motive and\naction/harm; pragmatically other factors could be considered in\ndrafting law. i think this was a confusion stemming from having a\nsomewhat different debate under the umbrella of another debate... ...\nserial killer ... reliant upon the individual in question and any\nsocietal traits of relevance ... and psychological differences between\nwo/men/children i think you misunderstood my point. once a person is\nin a position of power that enables them to abuse another person they\nare in that position of power, regardless of what social or personal\nforces enabled them to obtain that position. men may be more likely to\nfind themselves in that position, but there is no reason to think that\nwhen a woman does she would harm her victim any less. you mention\npsychological differences between wo/men/children in regards to rape\nand abuse, however i was a little unclear as to what you were saying\nexactly. could you clarify? i think you are right about age insofar as\nthe effects would be different. i admittedly, however, have not done\nas much research on the psychological effects (duration, severity,\netc.) of rape based upon gender. my understanding of psychology though\nis that responses tend to be very individualized and i know of men and\nwomen who have been abused and have exhibited similar\nphysical/psychological injuries as a result. if you could direct me to\nany research to the contrary i might be more persuaded to your side.\n... you both are physically abused severely and hospitalized. you\nwould feel your sister didn't suffer more than you?... what about a 6\nyear old younger brother (or son of yours), if the wounds would be\nidentical, you would not think of his trauma more than your own? the\nfirst scenario is not as neat an example for me as might appear; i am\ntransgender so i walk the line of both genders a bit. what i can say\nis that if i had a sibling of either sex who was physically abused the\nsame as i was i would view their immediate suffering as equal to mine.\nhow we respond psychologically i would consider to be more a\nconsequence of a confluence of factors rather than primarily or solely\ndue to our respective sex/gender. regarding age, i think i have\nclarified my stance on that matter. irrelevant given your own point\nwhat should be considered was the actual motive and harm inflicted.\nwe're assuming identical physical trauma as per your outline. that was\nnot quite my point. what i was getting at is that if two individuals\neach suffer the same injury (e.g. a broken arm) it is the same injury\n(e.g. still a broken arm). this is not a statement that all cases of\nabuse have the same degree of physical trauma. my point still stands:\nthere are men who have physically suffered greater injury than some\nwomen. we aren't examining actual cases so this debate remains purely\nhypothetical.... perhaps i misunderstood your argument then about the\nhypothetical... i thought you were saying that because my points were\nbased upon the hypothetical they could not account for variables. i\nthink this was connected to some earlier confusion over the\ncategories... more so than the damage inflicted? after all my initial\npoint was that the damage is compounded in cases of men assaulting\nwomen/animals/children given the extra trauma that they are completely\nhelpless. men (however meek) still have more of a fighting chance. i\nthink that hate motivated crimes should incur additional punishment.\nregarding the damage inflicted, i think there is room within the law\nfor the amount of damage done to be considered. there are different\ndegrees of assault and battery that already account for variability in\ndamage done. these are assessed based upon actual damage rather than\nupon presumed vulnerability and outcomes. i think it is flawed to\nstate that women cannot inflict as much injury upon a man as a man can\nupon a woman, even if it is less likely. your argument hinges upon\nhighly gendered ideas of vulnerability that do not always hold true.\nalso, as i have said before once one has a position of power over\nanother person (psychological and/or physical) then they can inflict\nwhat damage they will. part of abuse is that it generally does have\nthe psychological component, and there are men who will not fight back\nor may not be able to. why not let the damage be accounted for within\nthe pre-existing degree of damage system rather than assuming what\nthat damage will be? i don't disagree if you agree with me that\nviolently beating a child is worse than violently beating an adult (i\nreally dislike this topic at the moment...). i do agree, both that\nchild abuse is worse and that the topic is rather unpleasant.\nirrelevant since i was initially calling for change from the general\npractice, you're stating the obvious. valid point, consider mine\nconceded on that ground. i do need to demonstrate preferability rather\nthan assert tradition. a man can most likely at least flee, a woman\ncan be very easily subdued and prevented from fleeing violence in most\ncircumstances. as a final note (and at least somewhat touching on my\ninitial point [i feel you missed it]), a man that knows he has control\ndue to his strength and still assaulting a woman is far more unsound\n(based on motive [cruelty]) than a woman doing the same to a man.\nagain, i think i have tried to address this by arguing that the\nsituations are not so cut and dry as you make them seem. a man trapped\nin an abusive relationship is not necessarily more likely to flee as\nthe psychological effects and manipulations are the same, regardless\nof who is exercising them. further, why would a man repeating abuse be\nmore unsound than a woman doing so? they both abuse an imbalance of\npower over their partner. additionally, in your earlier post you\nmentioned man on man violence and seemed to think that should have a\nreduced sentence as well. i am curious to know how that factors into\nyour considerations, seeing as the safe presumption is that the\nabusive partner has greater strength and power in the relationship...\ni have more to say but i'll stop here likewise. i also have to mention\n, you make a more convincing argument on rebuttal than in the original\npost; consider it safe to say that i think more of the idea than i did\nbefore.",

you do realise that the equivalent of over 130\n9/11s (1 million peopl) have occurred in iraq since you invaded right,\nand even in afghanistan the numbers are in the tens of thousands ya.\n\"-i clearly worded my statement incorrectly, but it doesn't change the\nfact that israel is the only outspoken democracy in the middle east\nand democracies like this are what america stands for.\" my god man are\nyou that fucked in the head, the palestians live in horrible\nconditions and are trated like animals, they have had there land and\ntheir homes taken from them, what has gone on over the last few\ndecades is really one sided when it comes to gross breaches of human\nrights, and is tantamount to genocide. btw you don't need to tell me\nthat thjis is what america stands for yopu delluded fanatic. \"-how do\nwe fail to uphold them \"almost 100% of the time\" they are very rarely\n(nowadays) if ever not upheld.\" well killing osama bin laden for one,\nthe examples are infinite my friend just go looking for the and i\nassure you there will be no shortage in the supply(this is no\nexaggeration), heres a few to get you started, it has been proven that\nformer soldier bradley manning is being tortured (in order to\nimplicate julian assange) against the law because he leaked info.\ndetaling exactly how badly the iraqi people are suffering due to\namerican actions, the us is supposed to have a law that says after 60\ndays in action (libya) in a foreign country either it is made into a\nwar by congress or you pull your forces out of the region, this is\ncurrently being ignored as obama promised a few weeks ago that libya\nwould only be for a few days. again the fact that you even questioned\nthis shows only how misinformed and delluded you are. \"with so much\nfreedom to act and think as you, many people realize that a fairly\neasy way to become hear\" yes the internet has allowed much of\ndeception to be removed but the us propaganda machine is the most\ncomplex and sophisticated ever to come into existence, i urge you\nwatch noam chomskys \"manufacturing consent\". the us is very frigtened\nof how the internet has allowed real freedom of information and\nrecently hilary clinton said that they are beginning to lose the info.\nwar (which is code for their lies are becoming less and less\neffective) in order to secure a more substantial portion of the us\nbudget for this. \"even if it doesn't work every time, when you get a\nliberal judge, you can pull stuff like that and occasionally win.\n(there was another of your wildly innaccurate statements/accusations)\"\ncould you please elaborate on this\\, i dont reemeber making any claim\nfor or against this, what are you taking about here?

is that why you reverted to\nusing sarcasm as some kind of insult? its funny that you would use\nthat word (omniscient) because you often do act as if you are...\" i\nfelt the response desvered nothing more than sarcasm to be honest, if\ni get a respectful response i give a respectful response. \"one of your\nfavorite statistics is that of casualties in iraq as several million,\ni have a source that claims differently.\" i have never claimed that\nseveral million died in iraq, please shopw me where i stated this, i\nstated that it was 1 million and i got those figures from probably the\nmost comprehensive study done on the iraq war casualities which was\nperformed by the john hopkins universities, i know that there are\nconflicting sources but i think if you investigate this one it is the\nbest estimate currently available of the numbers that died as a result\nof the invasion, but you go ahead and think whatever propaganda you've\nbeen fed is correct. \"even when your statistics are right, you spin\nthem in such a way as to make it sound like it is america who is\nkilling all of the people\" i admit i am quite biased, look, in truth i\nknow its not always americas fault and that maybe i have been unfair\nin some of my descriptions but the only reasons i have been is that im\ncompensating for a view that in my mind is badly lacking on this site.\nnow if you think i have gotten facts or figures wrong please show what\nexactly you think is wrong, dont just accuse me, i admit i speculate\naliot but i pride myself on presenting what i beleive are the facts,\nwhile i can't say with 100% certainty that i have never presented\nsomething wrong on this site i can say that if i did (and i doubt i\ndid cause im pretty careful when it comes to presenting a nfact or a\nfigure) i didn't know it was wrong or inaccurate. \"in reality more\nmuslim citizens are killed by their radical countryman who view them\nas expendable in attempting to kill americans,\" they wouldnt feel to\nneed to if you didn't occupy their lands, thats a very weak argument\nand im sorry you can't see that. \"there have been several cases where\nterrorists will use shields of unarmed women and children in order to\nget close to americans and fight them.\" id expect no less from those\nbrutal extremists, what you think im on their side or that im trying\nto stand up for them? \"any way you spin it, american aid is the reason\nthat thousands and thousands of people are saved every year.\" those\nare proportionally insignificant relative to the deaths it causes, you\nreally need to open your mind a little and do some research on these\nthings you have no idea what your rerally taking about, the fact is\nthat the people who really need that aid rarely get it, firstly isreal\ngets the overwhelming majority of all of the aid given every year and\nthey use it to enhance their military in order to kill, secondly most\nof that aid goes onto the hands of tyrannical dictators of oppressors\ne.g. before mubarak was forced to leave he received the second largest\nproportion of the aid given by the us. this again is an incredibly\nweak argument. \"and the american military is the reason the middle\neast hasn't devolved into a nuclear war,\" no no you have this a little\nmixed up it should read: the american military will be the reason the\nmiddle east devolves into a nuclear war, or else isreal. there much\nbetter and now its actually true. \"and also the reason that sadaam\nhussein and osama bin laden, the two greatest mass murderers of our\ntime are dead.\" ok firstly both of these men were prooped up and\nsupported by america, or have you forgotten? secondly they are no\nwhere near the greatest mass murderers, saddam mkilled a good few ill\ngive you that but osama really hasnt killed all that many even if you\nattribute all the al queda related killing to him. on the other hand\nyou have the rwandan massacre, idi amin, polpot, george w bush, tony\nblair etc. so forth and so on -(yes thats right i do put those mass\nmurdering tyrants in with idi amin and polpot, they earned it) my\nsource: http://www.thewe.cc/weplanet/news/ middle_east/iraq/\n600000_deaths_in_iraq_continuing.htm this also neglects the death due\nto starvation, inadequate healthcare and poverty related death but if\none wanted you could make a ver convincing argument that america is\nlargely at fault for these aswell, prior to gulf 1 iraq was one of the\nmodern countrie in the middle east with teh finest healthcare and\neducation, gulf completely destroyed it, then came the inhuman\nsanction that the us forcibly imposed using the sway thy have at the\nun killing 500,000 children (check the red cross if you dont beleive\nme), then the second invasion to cripple them. now, is it so hard to\naccept that these facts have been intentionally concelaed from you\nnand many others in order not to lose support for the war, your\ngovernment learned a valuable lesson from vietnam, that they need to\ncontrol the flow of information in order to limit dissent and\ndiscontent in relation to slaughtering foreign peoples, they learned\nit well it seems."

                " when using words, i'm concerned with communication. making up a\npersonal definition for a word that already has a general definition\nis not useful to the goal of communication. arguing the on semantic\ngrounds for a definition that is personal and contrary to the general\ndefinition is a waste of time. worse then that, it is detrimental not\nonly to communication, but also to persuasion. getting down to the\nroot origins of words is useful to be concise on the meaning of those\nwords. our language fluctuates according to the \"authority\" of the day\nmaking their own definitions and putting it out there as if that is\nwhat they mean. when, in fact, obfuscation has been developed to cause\nconfusion on that very communication that you speak of. especially,\nthe truth. \"anarchy\" and \"government\" are both prime examples of what\ni mean. i have not made a personal definition of the word force. i\nmade a distinction of the words force and violence based on moral\ngrounds, or right action vs wrong action. it is in the how or use of\nwhat those words represent. i explained this multiple times.\ninitiating harm, or aggressing upon someone, is the wrong committed.\nusing whatever force is necessary to repel the attack is a person's\nright to do, or the right action to take. this applies to coercion,\nthe threat of harm done upon another to get them to do what you want,\nis wrong. i made the distinction on this, as well. with that, i will\n(re)post some definitions: freedom is the ability to act on one's own\njudgement concerning one's self and one's property, absent coercion or\nconstraint from other agents. now the definition for authority: right\nto give orders, make decisions, and enforce obedience. now government:\nthe mechanism by which a group of people regulate behavior within a\ngroup and determine collective goals or actions.\nhttps://www.dictionary.com/browse/authority?s=t\nhttps://www.dictionary.com/browse/government?s=t i posted the above\nlinks to keep things accurate. the definition you provided for\n\"authority\" sounds close. what i said concerning authority can be\nboiled down to this, you rule you and i rule me. as long as we respect\nthat we are fine. once that is disrespected by either one of us, we\nhave a problem or conflict. we have a right to rule our own lives and\nour property. we do not have a right to control others, or rule over\nthem. that is slavery. when someone is a guest in your home they have\na respect for what i said above. they recognize that it is your house,\nyour rules. when they disrespect that, you are within your rights to\nask them to stop, or leave. that would be an exercise of your\nauthority concerning your home. but once they leave, it no longer\napplies to them. this would also, apply to any individuals who get\ntogether and decide how they are going to operate, say a business or\nan association. they cannot come up with rules and then, force others\nto abide by such rules who have nothing to do with their business or\nassociation, etc. i broke down the etymology of the word \"government\".\nit stems from gubernare, as one variation i have seen. there is also,\nguberno, or gubernor, meaning to control, steer, direct, or guide,\netc. and mens, mentis, meaning the mind, along with a short list of\nsimilar words. https://www.online-latin-dictionary.com/latin-english-\ndictionary.php?parola=gubernare https://www.online-latin-\ndictionary.com/ latin-english-dictionary.php?parola=mens if you put\nthose words together, it really does translate to \"to control the\nmind\" or mind control. and the only place that exists is within each\nindividual on this planet. to attempt to do that to others is the same\nas enslaving them. i have already argued that we limit freedom all the\ntime in social interactions. we give subtle and overt warnings that\nare both verbal and non-verbal. these warnings are coercive since when\nthose warnings are not heeded, people sometimes fight about it. it\ndepends on how those warnings are used. if a person gives a warning to\nback off of them because someone is in their face, attempting to push\nthem around, they are right to do this. if the person that is in their\nface threatens them with physical assault if the other person does not\nobey them, that is wrong. that is coercion. such fights happen all the\ntime, though they are rare when compared to the times people heed to\nwarning signals of others. of you doubt this explanation, consider the\ninteractions of people on the internet, where no coercion is\nenforceable. again, \"your money or your life\" is not the same as \"back\noff of me, now, you are in my personal space\". the internet is\ndifferent in the sense that the interaction is not face to face or in\nperson. there are still options given, like on this forum where the\nmoderator can ban someone and keep them from interacting on the debate\nthat was created. the above is the subtle way in which we limit\nfreedom. your defense of your property is an example of you limiting\nthe freedom of the trespasser. did the trespassers \"abuse\" freedom?\nsure. he acted on his own judgement concerning himself, but he acted\nin a manner that interferes with your property. so you have the right\nto decide to order him out of your house, and to enforce his\nobedience. according to the above definitions, that's you exercising\nauthority to limit his freedom. if you accept that you have the right\nto kick out the trespasser, then you accept that freedom is not an\ninherent good (it can be abused), and authority is not an inherent\nevil (you have the authority to remove his freedom to trespass).\nfreedom is desirable. it has an inherent value. it is inherently good.\ni covered \"authority\" already. see above. if someone is trying to\npersuade another, that is not wrong. if someone is trying to use their\nown \"authority\" and force another, against their will, through\naggression, coercion, initiation of violence or fraud, that is wrong.\nmeaning that person who is doing that is acting immorally, to get\nanother to do their bidding. -if a person with dementia insists on\ngoing for a walk on a cold winters night without proper clothes,\npretty much anyone with the means has the right to restrict the\ndementia patients freedom and keep them in a warm environment. no,\nthey do not have that right. they can attempt to persuade them to do\notherwise. they can appeal to reason and give them other options. but\nno one has the right to restrict that persons free-will choice to do\nthat action. if a person does try it, they might have a fight on their\nhands, depending on the other person who is said to have dementia. and\ni wouldn't blame the latter. -if a person has already had too much\nheroin and they are ready to inject another full syringe, but this one\nis the good stuff with fentanyl, you have the right to take that\nsyringe, limiting.their freedom in the process. how much is \"too\nmuch\"? isn't heroin bad to take? isn't smoking bad for you? isn't a\nwhole host of habits, or vices, not a very good idea? where is the\nline drawn here? even in the above case, you would not be right.\nthough it might be forgivable by the one doing the heroin. you do not\nhave the right to tell people what they can and cannot do with their\nbodies, or to make them obey what you think they should or should not\ndo. -if a person is in the midst of an emotional crisis and they are\nactively attempting suicide, it's right to stop them long enough for\nthem to come through the crisis and get the help they need. it's\nright, and it restricts their freedom. again, you can persuade them\nnot to do it, if they are in fact trying that, and talk them out of\nit. but anyone who is determined to end their life, will do so. it is\nout of your hands. however, if you are attempting to stop them, using\nthe above methods, yeah you are in the right. convincing someone that\nthey do have a good reason to continue on is the correct way to go.\nbut you have to listen to them, effectively. what happens when you\nrecognize that they are dealing with something internally, but are not\nactively seeking to end it? you do not have the right to take away\ntheir freedom, simply because you cannot understand what is going on.\nthe best way, and right way, to handle that is to let them be. maybe,\nthey will ask your input. maybe, they will share what they are going\nthrough. but it is something that you cannot possibly understand,\nunless you were them or went through a similar experience. having them\nlocked up (restricting their freedom) does no good for them. that is\nnot help. and if they want help they will ask for it. you can even\noffer it, but you are not right to force it upon them. the above\nexamples infringe on the rights of people to harm themselves in very\ndifferent ways. self-harm due to cognitive deterioration, due to\naddiction (accidentally seeking death), and due to emotional crisis.\neach situation has a time horizon that the individual involved cannot\nsee. they want the freedom to act according to their own judgement\nnow, but later they are likely to seem that judgement differently. you\nwould be right to stop them. their freedom doesn't have inherent\nvalue, their life does. no, you wouldn't. you have a right to offer\nhelp, but ultimately, it is not your call. and it is not your life. it\nis theirs. their freedom absolutely, does have an inherent value.\ntheir life may be meaningless to them if they are locked up, but did\nnothing wrong. then, are released and made to take poison (that does\nnothing but, covers up their issues, in the least, and kills their\nspirit and emotions.) and if that medication effects them that way, it\nmay also, effect them in their mind and body, killing them physically.\nultimately, you did them no favors. acting in fearful ways does no\ngood in such situations. human freedom has an incredibly high value,\nbut that's because we need it, as animals of reason, to live and to\nthrive. the life has primacy. uh, we are more than just animals of\nreason. there is more to us than only our physical bodies. an\nindividual human being has a right to life, and they have a right to\ndecide what to do with their life, if it is not causing harm to other\nindividual human beings. no others are right to interfere with such an\nindividual. that is a healthy respect for life and freedom because one\nwithout the other, falls flat. if a person does not have true freedom,\nthey are not truly living, but existing under the control of someone\nelse, i.e. they are a slave. death is a part of life and we cannot\nescape it. just as you have the authority to hinder the freedom of the\nfreedom-abuser, a government has the authority to hinder the freedom\nof the freedom-abuser. by which i mean that people organizing a\nmechanism by which to regulate behavior are right to regulate freedom-\nabusers. i am right to stop the abuse, but that is as far as it goes.\ni would be right to defend another from abuse, as well. your\n\"government\", as it is today, is a criminal class. they act as if they\nhave \"special\" rights, above everyone else. they are serious freedom\nabusers. \"voting\" them out is not doing any good, but just lends\nsupport to what they are doing. and people are letting them get away\nwith it. it is an attempt to steal our freedoms and inalienable\nrights, from us. it has been done incrementally, but now, they are\nspeeding it up. and their enforcers (cops) are helping it happen. as i\nargued above, people regulate the behavior of others all the time.\nit's a natural consequence of interaction. the ways in which people\nregulate behavior are as numerous as individuals and circumstances.\nbut some limited circumstances involve so called freedom-abusers.\npeople feel victimized when one such interaction occurs. i'll call\nthose true crimes. when a true crime occurs, each of us respond in\nsingularly unique ways. that's actually a problem. how is that a\nproblem. we are individuals. we might be connected, but we are not the\nsame. i am not you or vice versa. i might handle a \"freedom-abuser\"\ndifferently, then, you. maybe, after a fight, we have a beer and\ndiscuss things. it could be he comes away from that interaction with a\nlesson learned and he becomes a changed man. acting on an individual\nbasis, with each other, is really all we have. regulating conduct in\nthat way is right, or correct. true crimes are highly emotional\nthings. hence, vigilantism is a highly emotional thing. as such it is\nvery often incorrect and imprecise in it's response. people organizing\na mechanism by which to regulate the behavior of vigilantes reduces,\nthough does not eliminate, the imprecision and inaccuracy of justice\nseekers. the only case that i know of, historically, of \"vigilantism\",\nis called the \"oxbow incident\". but those involved, if i remember\ncorrectly, were a law man and men who had been deputized, and\norganized into a posse. that was how they did it then. justice was\nswift and harsh. there was, also, an unwritten code of conduct that\npeople tended to operate by on the frontier. but, life there was often\ndull and boring to some. hollywood did a lot to obfuscate the truth of\nwhat really took place during those times. i said earlier that due\nprocess reduces the injustice of false positives which vigilantes are\nprone to and you only responded that it's doubtful. really? what did i\nfollow with on that? show me. that's an irrational doubt. due process\nhas laws (yes laws) requiring that standards of evidence be met before\na suspect can be prosecuted. there are no such standards in your\nanarchy. and evidence is manufactured very often, to get a conviction.\nthat's if it even goes to trial. typically, people are coerced into\nconfessing to something they did not do and taking a deal. such laws\nin the us start from a presumption of innocence, putting the onus of\nproof on the one seeking justice. as a result, guilty parties often\nwalk free. they can later capitalize on books that outline their\nguilt. and very often innocent people (who did no harm to anyone else)\nend up in prison. what you describe sounds good in theory, but it is\nnot working very well at all. that's not quite justice, but it's\nbetter than each individual presuming the guilt of the person they are\nreally really sure did the deed and then going and taking their\nvengeance as they see fit, then failing every time the actually guilty\nparty has the muscle for it. let me ask you. how did due process work\nfor randy weaver and his family at ruby ridge? he lost his wife and\nson. and those who pulled the trigger did not get locked up for it.\nhow about those who burned at waco? same scenario. the enforcers got\naway scot free. not to mention the \"government\" ruler at the time, was\nnot held to account for his orders. due process is necessarily a\nsystem of laws. it cannot exist absent government. it cannot exist in\nyour anarchy. and it hardly exists now, under your \"government\". with\nthe self-defense principle, anyone has a right to account for their\nactions. and there are options that people can come up with and use to\nput that principle into effect. it would be, largely, better than what\nwe have now. private resolution requires voluntary parties. but true\ncriminals, your abusers of freedom, are not interested in resolution.\nyou had to force the trespasser to leave, of not with threat, then\nwith force. and you had the right to order him to leave and enforce\nhis obedience. that's authority. yeah, and i covered \"authority\"\nalready. i am talking about attempting to rule/control others, outside\nof the right to do it for yourself. i am speaking about those who have\nnot aggressed or initiated harm on anyone else. no one has the right\nto do that. that is enslavement. and because that right does not\nexist, no matter how many people get together to try and make it\nright, it renders your \"government\" non-existent. which means that\nthey are a gigantic criminal organization, imagined to have the right\nto exist. it is a false belief system and a religion. a very dangerous\none. this applies to the world over, as well. not just here. this is\nmy perspective on what the truth is.",
                " \"you continuously make claims that we keep down the poor to make\nmoney\" read the book the shock doctrine by naomi klein and i assure\nyou that you will not disagree with this sentiment simplistic though\nit may be. \"you claim that are motives for taking down sadaam are\ndifferent than what we stated them to be, so don't try and say you\ndon't \"claim to know the motives of anyone\"\" what i meant was i dont\nclaim to know the motives of anyone single person, but power acts in\ncertain ways so when it comes to us hegemony i do believe i have\ndecenjt idea ya. \"americans have not killed \"tens (maybe hundreds) of\nthousands\" iranian civilians, the number actually killed by american\nsoldiers pales in comparison to the numbers that their own people\nkill.\" this is complete horseshit and fact that you beleive this only\nproves that you've bought into a great big lie. 1 million have died\nsince the invasion, i million, you think these were all enemy\ncombatants. what about the 500,000 children who died when the us\nforcibly imposed strict sanctions on saddam after gulf 1, watch this\ndocumentary if you dont beleive this, the info. is sourced from the\nred cross, there about as unbiased as it gets:\nhttp://www.johnpilger.com/videos/ paying-the-price-killing-the-\nchildren-o f-iraq \"you can't say that bohemian doesn't and then turn\naround say that you actually do, how are we supposed\" firstly i never\nsaid he feels nthing about the death sof people i claimed he values\nwestern blood above others, also i think that given he is currently\nworking for an organisation like the us army that does much harm to so\nmany for self interested reasons it is perfectly reasonable for me to\nassume that he could rationalise the deaths of many more people given\nthat he has rationalised the deaths of all that have already died\n(look back in posts and read this for yourself) \"you can't just take\nsomething that personal and then assume someone is lying\" i never said\nhe was lying, i made no such statement. \"your exaggerations are\nhorrendous\" this is no fucking exaggeration, 500,000 isreals settlers\ncurrently live on palestian land and that number is growing, finally\nobama has recognised the need for a settlement based on 1967 broders\nas per international law but he will not act on it, and the isrealis\nhave no intention of giving back the land anyway they want more. \"the\nreason israel is in an area where they need our funding in order to\ndefend and hold onto their land is because of a real genocide\" what\nare you even taking about, this really only proves how misinformed you\nare and how you have lapped up the lies being fed to you and then\nasked for seconds. \"if you want to talk about genocide look at the\n9/11 attacks.\" wtf? you do realise that the equivalent of over 130\n9/11s (1 million peopl) have occurred in iraq since you invaded right,\nand even in afghanistan the numbers are in the tens of thousands ya.\n\"-i clearly worded my statement incorrectly, but it doesn't change the\nfact that israel is the only outspoken democracy in the middle east\nand democracies like this are what america stands for.\" my god man are\nyou that fucked in the head, the palestians live in horrible\nconditions and are trated like animals, they have had there land and\ntheir homes taken from them, what has gone on over the last few\ndecades is really one sided when it comes to gross breaches of human\nrights, and is tantamount to genocide. btw you don't need to tell me\nthat thjis is what america stands for yopu delluded fanatic. \"-how do\nwe fail to uphold them \"almost 100% of the time\" they are very rarely\n(nowadays) if ever not upheld.\" well killing osama bin laden for one,\nthe examples are infinite my friend just go looking for the and i\nassure you there will be no shortage in the supply(this is no\nexaggeration), heres a few to get you started, it has been proven that\nformer soldier bradley manning is being tortured (in order to\nimplicate julian assange) against the law because he leaked info.\ndetaling exactly how badly the iraqi people are suffering due to\namerican actions, the us is supposed to have a law that says after 60\ndays in action (libya) in a foreign country either it is made into a\nwar by congress or you pull your forces out of the region, this is\ncurrently being ignored as obama promised a few weeks ago that libya\nwould only be for a few days. again the fact that you even questioned\nthis shows only how misinformed and delluded you are. \"with so much\nfreedom to act and think as you, many people realize that a fairly\neasy way to become hear\" yes the internet has allowed much of\ndeception to be removed but the us propaganda machine is the most\ncomplex and sophisticated ever to come into existence, i urge you\nwatch noam chomskys \"manufacturing consent\". the us is very frigtened\nof how the internet has allowed real freedom of information and\nrecently hilary clinton said that they are beginning to lose the info.\nwar (which is code for their lies are becoming less and less\neffective) in order to secure a more substantial portion of the us\nbudget for this. \"even if it doesn't work every time, when you get a\nliberal judge, you can pull stuff like that and occasionally win.\n(there was another of your wildly innaccurate statements/accusations)\"\ncould you please elaborate on this\\, i dont reemeber making any claim\nfor or against this, what are you taking about here? \"i do not come\nonto this site to continuously accuse other people, i do it to debate\ntopics. you however rarely make an argument that doesn't accuse people\nof something\" i accuse those who deserve to be accuse, dont through\nthat in my face and think its going to makie me stop, if i kill\nsomeone and somebody accuses me i dont say, you have no right to\naccuse me, come fucking off it man. \"-you expected what treatment?\npeople to call out what you say and point out that much of it is just\naccusations? \" no what i meant is i expectd many americans to be\nvehemently opposed to my piont of view and to attack it with much\nrigour, i have also been labelled anti-american which i find\ninsulting, i have also been labelled a fanatic (again im not to fond\nof that), but as i said i expected this treatment, americans need to\nlive their lie as if they had to admit to themselves that for the past\n80yrs they have been anything but a force for good in the world\nfirstly they'd feel really really bad (at the ones with consciences\nand in fairness most americans have big hearts im not joking) and\nsecondly they'd have to stop which means they'd have to force their\ngovernment and the ruling elites to stop perpetuating the cycle of\npower hungriness, again this is all very hypthetical but you get the\nidea. \"-so you have no response to that? is that why you reverted to\nusing sarcasm as some kind of insult? its funny that you would use\nthat word (omniscient) because you often do act as if you are...\" i\nfelt the response desvered nothing more than sarcasm to be honest, if\ni get a respectful response i give a respectful response. \"one of your\nfavorite statistics is that of casualties in iraq as several million,\ni have a source that claims differently.\" i have never claimed that\nseveral million died in iraq, please shopw me where i stated this, i\nstated that it was 1 million and i got those figures from probably the\nmost comprehensive study done on the iraq war casualities which was\nperformed by the john hopkins universities, i know that there are\nconflicting sources but i think if you investigate this one it is the\nbest estimate currently available of the numbers that died as a result\nof the invasion, but you go ahead and think whatever propaganda you've\nbeen fed is correct. \"even when your statistics are right, you spin\nthem in such a way as to make it sound like it is america who is\nkilling all of the people\" i admit i am quite biased, look, in truth i\nknow its not always americas fault and that maybe i have been unfair\nin some of my descriptions but the only reasons i have been is that im\ncompensating for a view that in my mind is badly lacking on this site.\nnow if you think i have gotten facts or figures wrong please show what\nexactly you think is wrong, dont just accuse me, i admit i speculate\naliot but i pride myself on presenting what i beleive are the facts,\nwhile i can't say with 100% certainty that i have never presented\nsomething wrong on this site i can say that if i did (and i doubt i\ndid cause im pretty careful when it comes to presenting a nfact or a\nfigure) i didn't know it was wrong or inaccurate. \"in reality more\nmuslim citizens are killed by their radical countryman who view them\nas expendable in attempting to kill americans,\" they wouldnt feel to\nneed to if you didn't occupy their lands, thats a very weak argument\nand im sorry you can't see that. \"there have been several cases where\nterrorists will use shields of unarmed women and children in order to\nget close to americans and fight them.\" id expect no less from those\nbrutal extremists, what you think im on their side or that im trying\nto stand up for them? \"any way you spin it, american aid is the reason\nthat thousands and thousands of people are saved every year.\" those\nare proportionally insignificant relative to the deaths it causes, you\nreally need to open your mind a little and do some research on these\nthings you have no idea what your rerally taking about, the fact is\nthat the people who really need that aid rarely get it, firstly isreal\ngets the overwhelming majority of all of the aid given every year and\nthey use it to enhance their military in order to kill, secondly most\nof that aid goes onto the hands of tyrannical dictators of oppressors\ne.g. before mubarak was forced to leave he received the second largest\nproportion of the aid given by the us. this again is an incredibly\nweak argument. \"and the american military is the reason the middle\neast hasn't devolved into a nuclear war,\" no no you have this a little\nmixed up it should read: the american military will be the reason the\nmiddle east devolves into a nuclear war, or else isreal. there much\nbetter and now its actually true. \"and also the reason that sadaam\nhussein and osama bin laden, the two greatest mass murderers of our\ntime are dead.\" ok firstly both of these men were prooped up and\nsupported by america, or have you forgotten? secondly they are no\nwhere near the greatest mass murderers, saddam mkilled a good few ill\ngive you that but osama really hasnt killed all that many even if you\nattribute all the al queda related killing to him. on the other hand\nyou have the rwandan massacre, idi amin, polpot, george w bush, tony\nblair etc. so forth and so on -(yes thats right i do put those mass\nmurdering tyrants in with idi amin and polpot, they earned it) my\nsource: http://www.thewe.cc/weplanet/news/ middle_east/iraq/\n600000_deaths_in_iraq_continuing.htm this also neglects the death due\nto starvation, inadequate healthcare and poverty related death but if\none wanted you could make a ver convincing argument that america is\nlargely at fault for these aswell, prior to gulf 1 iraq was one of the\nmodern countrie in the middle east with teh finest healthcare and\neducation, gulf completely destroyed it, then came the inhuman\nsanction that the us forcibly imposed using the sway thy have at the\nun killing 500,000 children (check the red cross if you dont beleive\nme), then the second invasion to cripple them. now, is it so hard to\naccept that these facts have been intentionally concelaed from you\nnand many others in order not to lose support for the war, your\ngovernment learned a valuable lesson from vietnam, that they need to\ncontrol the flow of information in order to limit dissent and\ndiscontent in relation to slaughtering foreign peoples, they learned\nit well it seems."

                " when using words, i'm concerned with communication. making up a\npersonal definition for a word that already has a general definition\nis not useful to the goal of communication. arguing the on semantic\ngrounds for a definition that is personal and contrary to the general\ndefinition is a waste of time. worse then that, it is detrimental not\nonly to communication, but also to persuasion. getting down to the\nroot origins of words is useful to be concise on the meaning of those\nwords. our language fluctuates according to the \"authority\" of the day\nmaking their own definitions and putting it out there as if that is\nwhat they mean. when, in fact, obfuscation has been developed to cause\nconfusion on that very communication that you speak of. especially,\nthe truth. \"anarchy\" and \"government\" are both prime examples of what\ni mean. i have not made a personal definition of the word force. i\nmade a distinction of the words force and violence based on moral\ngrounds, or right action vs wrong action. it is in the how or use of\nwhat those words represent. i explained this multiple times.\ninitiating harm, or aggressing upon someone, is the wrong committed.\nusing whatever force is necessary to repel the attack is a person's\nright to do, or the right action to take. this applies to coercion,\nthe threat of harm done upon another to get them to do what you want,\nis wrong. i made the distinction on this, as well. with that, i will\n(re)post some definitions: freedom is the ability to act on one's own\njudgement concerning one's self and one's property, absent coercion or\nconstraint from other agents. now the definition for authority: right\nto give orders, make decisions, and enforce obedience. now government:\nthe mechanism by which a group of people regulate behavior within a\ngroup and determine collective goals or actions.\nhttps://www.dictionary.com/browse/authority?s=t\nhttps://www.dictionary.com/browse/government?s=t i posted the above\nlinks to keep things accurate. the definition you provided for\n\"authority\" sounds close. what i said concerning authority can be\nboiled down to this, you rule you and i rule me. as long as we respect\nthat we are fine. once that is disrespected by either one of us, we\nhave a problem or conflict. we have a right to rule our own lives and\nour property. we do not have a right to control others, or rule over\nthem. that is slavery. when someone is a guest in your home they have\na respect for what i said above. they recognize that it is your house,\nyour rules. when they disrespect that, you are within your rights to\nask them to stop, or leave. that would be an exercise of your\nauthority concerning your home. but once they leave, it no longer\napplies to them. this would also, apply to any individuals who get\ntogether and decide how they are going to operate, say a business or\nan association. they cannot come up with rules and then, force others\nto abide by such rules who have nothing to do with their business or\nassociation, etc. i broke down the etymology of the word \"government\".\nit stems from gubernare, as one variation i have seen. there is also,\nguberno, or gubernor, meaning to control, steer, direct, or guide,\netc. and mens, mentis, meaning the mind, along with a short list of\nsimilar words. https://www.online-latin-dictionary.com/latin-english-\ndictionary.php?parola=gubernare https://www.online-latin-\ndictionary.com/ latin-english-dictionary.php?parola=mens if you put\nthose words together, it really does translate to \"to control the\nmind\" or mind control. and the only place that exists is within each\nindividual on this planet. to attempt to do that to others is the same\nas enslaving them. i have already argued that we limit freedom all the\ntime in social interactions. we give subtle and overt warnings that\nare both verbal and non-verbal. these warnings are coercive since when\nthose warnings are not heeded, people sometimes fight about it. it\ndepends on how those warnings are used. if a person gives a warning to\nback off of them because someone is in their face, attempting to push\nthem around, they are right to do this. if the person that is in their\nface threatens them with physical assault if the other person does not\nobey them, that is wrong. that is coercion. such fights happen all the\ntime, though they are rare when compared to the times people heed to\nwarning signals of others. of you doubt this explanation, consider the\ninteractions of people on the internet, where no coercion is\nenforceable. again, \"your money or your life\" is not the same as \"back\noff of me, now, you are in my personal space\". the internet is\ndifferent in the sense that the interaction is not face to face or in\nperson. there are still options given, like on this forum where the\nmoderator can ban someone and keep them from interacting on the debate\nthat was created. the above is the subtle way in which we limit\nfreedom. your defense of your property is an example of you limiting\nthe freedom of the trespasser. did the trespassers \"abuse\" freedom?\nsure. he acted on his own judgement concerning himself, but he acted\nin a manner that interferes with your property. so you have the right\nto decide to order him out of your house, and to enforce his\nobedience. according to the above definitions, that's you exercising\nauthority to limit his freedom. if you accept that you have the right\nto kick out the trespasser, then you accept that freedom is not an\ninherent good (it can be abused), and authority is not an inherent\nevil (you have the authority to remove his freedom to trespass).\nfreedom is desirable. it has an inherent value. it is inherently good.\ni covered \"authority\" already. see above. if someone is trying to\npersuade another, that is not wrong. if someone is trying to use their\nown \"authority\" and force another, against their will, through\naggression, coercion, initiation of violence or fraud, that is wrong.\nmeaning that person who is doing that is acting immorally, to get\nanother to do their bidding. -if a person with dementia insists on\ngoing for a walk on a cold winters night without proper clothes,\npretty much anyone with the means has the right to restrict the\ndementia patients freedom and keep them in a warm environment. no,\nthey do not have that right. they can attempt to persuade them to do\notherwise. they can appeal to reason and give them other options. but\nno one has the right to restrict that persons free-will choice to do\nthat action. if a person does try it, they might have a fight on their\nhands, depending on the other person who is said to have dementia. and\ni wouldn't blame the latter. -if a person has already had too much\nheroin and they are ready to inject another full syringe, but this one\nis the good stuff with fentanyl, you have the right to take that\nsyringe, limiting.their freedom in the process. how much is \"too\nmuch\"? isn't heroin bad to take? isn't smoking bad for you? isn't a\nwhole host of habits, or vices, not a very good idea? where is the\nline drawn here? even in the above case, you would not be right.\nthough it might be forgivable by the one doing the heroin. you do not\nhave the right to tell people what they can and cannot do with their\nbodies, or to make them obey what you think they should or should not\ndo. -if a person is in the midst of an emotional crisis and they are\nactively attempting suicide, it's right to stop them long enough for\nthem to come through the crisis and get the help they need. it's\nright, and it restricts their freedom. again, you can persuade them\nnot to do it, if they are in fact trying that, and talk them out of\nit. but anyone who is determined to end their life, will do so. it is\nout of your hands. however, if you are attempting to stop them, using\nthe above methods, yeah you are in the right. convincing someone that\nthey do have a good reason to continue on is the correct way to go.\nbut you have to listen to them, effectively. what happens when you\nrecognize that they are dealing with something internally, but are not\nactively seeking to end it? you do not have the right to take away\ntheir freedom, simply because you cannot understand what is going on.\nthe best way, and right way, to handle that is to let them be. maybe,\nthey will ask your input. maybe, they will share what they are going\nthrough. but it is something that you cannot possibly understand,\nunless you were them or went through a similar experience. having them\nlocked up (restricting their freedom) does no good for them. that is\nnot help. and if they want help they will ask for it. you can even\noffer it, but you are not right to force it upon them. the above\nexamples infringe on the rights of people to harm themselves in very\ndifferent ways. self-harm due to cognitive deterioration, due to\naddiction (accidentally seeking death), and due to emotional crisis.\neach situation has a time horizon that the individual involved cannot\nsee. they want the freedom to act according to their own judgement\nnow, but later they are likely to seem that judgement differently. you\nwould be right to stop them. their freedom doesn't have inherent\nvalue, their life does. no, you wouldn't. you have a right to offer\nhelp, but ultimately, it is not your call. and it is not your life. it\nis theirs. their freedom absolutely, does have an inherent value.\ntheir life may be meaningless to them if they are locked up, but did\nnothing wrong. then, are released and made to take poison (that does\nnothing but, covers up their issues, in the least, and kills their\nspirit and emotions.) and if that medication effects them that way, it\nmay also, effect them in their mind and body, killing them physically.\nultimately, you did them no favors. acting in fearful ways does no\ngood in such situations. human freedom has an incredibly high value,\nbut that's because we need it, as animals of reason, to live and to\nthrive. the life has primacy. uh, we are more than just animals of\nreason. there is more to us than only our physical bodies. an\nindividual human being has a right to life, and they have a right to\ndecide what to do with their life, if it is not causing harm to other\nindividual human beings. no others are right to interfere with such an\nindividual. that is a healthy respect for life and freedom because one\nwithout the other, falls flat. if a person does not have true freedom,\nthey are not truly living, but existing under the control of someone\nelse, i.e. they are a slave. death is a part of life and we cannot\nescape it. just as you have the authority to hinder the freedom of the\nfreedom-abuser, a government has the authority to hinder the freedom\nof the freedom-abuser. by which i mean that people organizing a\nmechanism by which to regulate behavior are right to regulate freedom-\nabusers. i am right to stop the abuse, but that is as far as it goes.\ni would be right to defend another from abuse, as well. your\n\"government\", as it is today, is a criminal class. they act as if they\nhave \"special\" rights, above everyone else. they are

man. acting on an individual\nbasis, with each other, is really all we have. regulating conduct in\nthat way is right, or correct. true crimes are highly emotional\nthings. hence, vigilantism is a highly emotional thing. as such it is\nvery often incorrect and imprecise in it's response. people organizing\na mechanism by which to regulate the behavior of vigilantes reduces,\nthough does not

is manufactured very often, to get a conviction.\nthat's if it even goes to trial. typically, people are coerced into\nconfessing to something they did not do and taking a deal. such laws\nin the us start from a presumption of innocence, putting the onus of\nproof on the one seeking justice. as a result, guilty parties often\nwalk free. they can later capitalize on books that outline their\nguilt. and very often innocent people (who did no harm to anyone else)\nend up in prison. what you describe sounds good in theory, but it is\nnot working very well at all. that's not quite justice, but it's\nbetter than each individual presuming the guilt of the person they are\nreally really sure did the deed and then going and taking their\nvengeance as they see fit, then failing every time the actually guilty\nparty has the muscle for it. let me ask you. how did due process work\nfor randy weaver and his family at ruby ridge? he lost his wife and\nson. and those who pulled the trigger did not get locked up for it.\nhow about those who burned at waco? same scenario. the enforcers got\naway scot free. not to mention the \"government\" ruler at the time, was\nnot held to account for his orders. due process is necessarily a\nsystem of laws. it cannot exist absent government. it cannot exist in\nyour anarchy. and it hardly exists now, under your \"government\". with\nthe self-defense principle, anyone has a right to account for their\nactions. and there are options that people can come up with and use to\nput that principle into effect. it would be, largely, better than what\nwe have now. private resolution requires voluntary parties. but true\ncriminals, your abusers of freedom, are not interested in resolution.\nyou had to force the trespasser to leave, of not with threat, then\nwith force. and you had the right to order him to leave and enforce\nhis obedience. that's authority. yeah, and i covered \"authority\"\nalready. i am talking about attempting to rule/control others, outside\nof the right to do it for yourself. i am speaking about those who have\nnot aggressed or initiated harm on anyone else. no one has the right\nto do that. that is enslavement. and because that right does not\nexist, no matter how many people get together to try and make it\nright, it renders your \"government\" non-existent. which means that\nthey are a gigantic criminal organization, imagined to have the right\nto exist. it is a false belief system and a religion. a very dangerous\none. this applies to the world over, as well. not just here. this is\nmy perspective on what the truth is.",
                " you see a war i see anm occupation of another country, i dont think\nyou have teh best interests of the iraqis people at heart well,\nregardless of what you see, i'll tell you what isn't in the best\ninterest of the iraqis. abruptly leaving iraq, so that the iraqis must\ndeal with the insurgency and radical islam by themselves. they deserve\nthe right to determine their own futures without western interference.\ni agree. i also think americans deserve to not have planes flown into\ntheir skyscrapers. they are not \"physically\" on your land, this is a\nbs argument and you know it. they don't have to physically be in the\nstates to launch attacks on us soil or us citizens. they have set foot\non us soil, they simply hide in plain sight. they are no different\nthan international assassins, the only difference is instead of\ntargeting important leaders, they target as many people as they can\npossibly kill. rogue guerrillas are no morally superior to traditional\narmies. this argument is bullocks! if your countries imperial presence\nwas removed from all these places (i.e. iraq, afghanistan, pakistan\netc. etc.) and attacks on the us continued then you'd have a piont,\nand then i would support you. we were attacked before we occupied any\ncountry. how many times must i say this before it sinks in that your\nargument is factually incorrect? listen to yourself, your compltely\ndeluded, ok lets say your right about this, lets put it to the test\nshall we. a rational person would look at history to see how\nsituations such as this have been carried out before. i think iran is\na pefect example. in iran you installed the sha how many 9/11\nhijackers were iranians? i'll answer that question. zero. al qaeda\ndoesn't dislike dictators, they dislike secular dictators. as long as\nthe dictator is imposing sharia law, and represents fundamentalist\nislam, they don't care. despite the overthrow of democratically\nelected leader mohammad mosaddegh, being a grave mistake under the\ndirection of churchill and eisenhower, it didn't affect radical islam\nall that much because mosaddegh was a secular leader, whom they didn't\nlike anyway. so this had nothing to do with al qaeda's decision to\nattack the united states. next argument. i think the sheer number of\nus bases all over the world coupled with your unbeleivable influence\ntells a very different story. unfortunately, the number of military\nbases a nation owns has nothing to do with whether it is imperial or\nnot. imperial nation = empire an empire is one which seeks to expand\nit's borders through military conquest. the last time we acquired any\nnew land from military conquest was in our war with spain, in which we\ncame to own the philippines a spanish colony, we no longer own the\nphillipines after we granted them their independence. ww1 was\njustified, i know that, i knew you pick at that one in order to\ndiscredit me, by last century i meant in the last 80yrs, mainly post\nww2 ^ moving the goal post. gulf 1 was not justified yes it was. iraq\nhad invaded kuwait unprovoked and declared it as part of their own\ncountry. the rest of the world largely saw this as a criminal act by\niraq, and the united states along with nearly 40 other nations moved\nin to destroy their military to prevent them from doing this again.\nwhat you mean hiroshima and nagasaki the interesting thing about this\nis that, if us foreign policy were the primary cause of islamic\nextremism, then why do we not see japanese terrorism around the world\nlike we do islamic extremism? what we did to japan was many times\nworse than anything we have ever done to any islamic nation. so why\nare we not dealing with japanese terrorists? the simple truth is that\nislamic extremism is not rational, their acts of violence are not\nproportional to any acts committed against them, and they will often\nbe the initiators of violence and not just the retaliators. al qaeda\ntargeted the united states because we captured 4 jihadists who were\nplanning to blow up an egyptian market place, and we handed them over\nto egyptian officials who then tried, tortured, and then executed\nthese bombers. osama bin laden said one reason why they attacked the\nus embassy in kenya was because of our \"interference\" in sudan. in\nsudan there was a civil war which resulted in a fundamentalist islamic\ndictator gaafar nimeiry taking control of the country, who: \"...allied\nhimself with the muslim brotherhood. in 1983, he imposed sharia, or\nislamic law, throughout the country\u2014alienating the predominantly\nchristian and animist south. the administrative boundaries of the\nsouth were also reformed. in violation of the addis ababa agreement he\ndissolved the southern sudanese government, thereby prompting a\nrenewal of the civil war.\" he also executed a peaceful political\ndissident. i dont know of course you don't because it doesn't coincide\nwith reality. ......actually this will take far too long, here watch\nthis lecture watch this video by christopher hitchens:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=rcjasowr6sc im not going to try to\ndefned al queda, there actions are as bad as you say they are, but\ntheir formation was a response to us hegemony no it wasn't. this is\ndemonstrably false. al qaeda existed before we had any real contact\nwith them. according to osama bin laden's himself. he attacked us\nbecause of our capture of 4 jihadist bombers and their rendition back\nto egyptian and because of our condemnation of the islamic dictator of\nsudan after their first sudanese civil war. this is why they attacked\nus in the first place. al qaeda for years had been responsible for\nmany bombings, which they used to oppose secular governments within\nthe muslim world. only those governments that enforced sharia law\nincluding requirements that women cover themselves, were safe from al\nqaeda. osama bin laden was a follower of a man named sayyid qutb who\nsaid that the way to bring about this freedom was for a revolutionary\nvanguard to fight jahiliyyah with a twofold approach: preaching, and\nabolishing the organizations and authorities of the jahili system by\n\"physical power and jihad.\" jahiliyyah- means \"ignorance of divine\nguidance\", it is an epithet for secularism. do some more research\nbehind the motivations of al qaeda, and you will see it is much more\ncomplicated than you believe."

                " yes: for a number of reasons. it is a highly emotive subject, with\nmost of the separation between the two sides of the argument boiling\ndown to what rights an unborn child should have. to me, i don't think\na 2-3 inch long collection of cells, that can't feel pain, is not a\n\"person\" in any meaningful sense of the word; and that collection of\ncells' rights must take a second priority to those of the women who\nwill otherwise be required to keep, give birth and raise the baby that\nwould eventually result. i respect the other point of view, but i\nthink enough on one other side would generally like to force arguments\nto degenerate into accusations of immorality and murdering, with the\nother degenerating into accusations of women-hating, \"it's my body\",\nwhich is equally useless. when you actually talk to enough people,\nit's really not about being \"pro-life\" or not, most often \"pro-life\"\npeople are happy to either kill, or let people die in other scenarios:\nin reality, it's mostly about disagreeing with the situations and\nscenarios where ending a life is acceptable. back to the question: the\nissue with reproductive rights are two fold. the first is that the\nconsequences on a women for an unintended or unplanned pregnancy can\nbe devestating. the woman may not be able to complete school or study,\nthey could be dependent on the state, or have them and their children\nin an environment with a much lower quality of life, and being far\nless able to realize their individual potential. the second is simple:\ndespite contributing at least 50% to the mistake, the men suffer\neffectively 0% of the consequences. this is not to say that many men\ndon't want to be involved, or aren't: the social paradigm right now is\nthat it's the woman that care and raise the baby; meaning a woman\nleaving a guy with the child is perceived far more negatively than a\nguy leaving a woman with the child upon a breakdown of a relationship.\nit cuts both ways, but the effective and essential problem; is that in\nmany situations and scenario's, men don't have as much skin in the\ngame; and yet are part of the mistake in the first place. a lot of the\ntime, it's not even a conscious thing: there is an inherent social and\ncultural barrier to guys fully empathizing with issues of unwanted or\nundesired pregnancy because guys don't get to fully experience the\nissues or the problems: we don't know what we don't know. for example,\ni doubt that i, as a guy, will fully appreciate how a woman feels when\na test for an unwanted pregnancy comes up negative: i can try, but\nmost of it will be based on my experiences and understanding of a guy\nwhich are inherently different. it's this \"reproductive equality\"\nwhich i think is critical here and is fundamentally about what a\nwoman's control over her own body really means. it is for this reason,\nthat every woman should have access to that same reproductive\nequality: which is based on comprehensive and credible sex and\nrelationship education, free and cheap access to contraception, and\nfree access to abortion: requiring government financial assistance.\nnow, saying this; there is a limit to this. as i said before a 2-3\ninch collection of cells that can't feel pain, etc, etc, shouldn't be\nafforded preferential rights over the woman. but there is a blurry\nline as the weeks pass, and there does come a point where the ethical\nline between rights of the mother and the baby balance out. i mean, we\ndon't go around aborting small children, for example: so there is a\nline somewhere. i generally feel that around the time a child is\nviable outside the womb is where the line is normally drawn with a few\nexceptions: rape or abuse: where the woman has not made any sort of\nchoice, and potentially has good reason not to seek abortion prior to\nthis. situations where the mother's life is at risk, that there is a\nhealth crisis, or situations where the unborn child is unlikely to\nsurvive, or be born with crippling or devastating abnormalities. the\nfundamental problem, in my view: is that this debate is about either\ntrying to make abortion more, or less accessible depending on which\nside you are on. in reality, i'm sure both sides could agree that\nminimizing abortion (provided it's accessible) is a good thing:\ntackling the fundamental driving forces behind abortion is the best\napproach for both sides here. things like access to healtcare,\nchildcare, paid maternity leave, and laws concerning training and\nemployment, etc is all likely to significantly reduce the amount of\nabortion: as financial and life impacts are most frequently cited as a\nreason for abortion. access to comprehensive and credible sex\neducation; together with relationship education rather than simply\n\"abstinence\" or no education would limit the number of unwanted\npregnancy in the first place too. it seems that not enough attention\nis paid to these topic, and too much focus placed on being \"pro-birth\"\nand being completely disinterested in every other aspect of these\npeoples life."

that market exists within a\nlarger framework provided by government. the market cannot itself\nprovide that framework because that framework necessarily relies on a\nmonopoly on the initiation of force independent of market forces such\nas profit. the government does things it shouldn't. it does not follow\nfrom that fact that the government shouldn't do anything. no it is\nnot. no one should have a monopoly on these things...so, the truth is\nthat it is a monopoly on violence. something no one has a right to do\nto anyone else. that's not true. and if my family is killed, i have\nthe right to seek justice with the means i have available. if that\nmeans i go after the killer myself, then, i will do so. the person you\nbelieve is the killer has a right to due process. that process is\nnecessarily a legal process. that's why you don't have the right to\ntake it upon yourself. if there's no government, then there's no\npossibility for due process. in that case, you and anyone else can\nseek retribution against whomever you believe is guilty for whatever\nreason. and we would all be much worse off. and you are calling it a\nlegal institution, yet it is private. so, what do you mean when you\nsay \"legal institution\"? is it private, public, or do you see no\ndifference? that's my mistake. they are building an institution where\nlegal institutions are weak. of there were no legal institutions,\npeople would create them. no, the cop follows orders. one definition\nof profit is a valuable return, not necessarily money. it could\nsomething akin to human resources in the form of more prisoners for\nhuman labor. private prisons thrive on this. cops aren't allowed to\njust follow orders. when an illegal order is followed, they get sued\nand fired and sometimes imprisoned. cops follows laws and policies.\norders must be within law and policy for a cop to claim they were\njustified in acting on the order. politicians, for example, would be\nconsidered ruling class. anyone can become a politician and the claim\nis through the actions and operations of these people. do you mean the\nprocess of legislation? enforcement? judicial operations? as for\n\"ruling over other's ability to enter my property\" i have covered this\nalready. i am not ruling over anyone. claiming such a right is the\nsame as enslaving someone. i have not done this with the protection of\nmy home and family, or myself. you are limiting a trespassers freedom\nwith barriers and, if that barrier is breached, you are using violence\nor the threat of violence to remove them (coercion). you are claiming\nthe right to do so. when you explain that it is your right to do so,\nyou aren't negating the fact that this is what you're doing. it is\nabsolutely different. did you read what i said? if the act does no\nharm to others, then, it is a right action. that's not true. an action\ncan cause no harm to others and still be wrong. i described nothing\nabout the trespasser that implies harm to you or your family. the\nperson is merely where you don't want them to be. how are you acting\ndifferent from government? as i pointed out above they tell me and\neveryone else how to live their lives, what they can or cannot do with\ntheir bodies, etc. you tell the trespasser what he cannot do, then you\nphysically enforce it if they disobey. the government has a law that\nsays they will punish you for assaulting someone. they will punish you\nis a predetermined way in accordance with predetermined rules and only\nafter you're granted due process. but to you, this is out of bounds.\nit's far better than your alternative. i have a right to protect my\nhome , family, and myself from harm. that is, it is a right action,\nthat does no harm to anyone else in doing so. you're claiming that\nright. but you perceive harm in a trespasser where the trespasser\nperceived no harm. are you really going to keep this stranger from\nfinishing his 6 pack on your couch? will you initiate violence against\nhim to see home off your property? this is the same as anyone has the\nright to do. it is not what i call a wrongful act, it is the truth. an\nact that causes harm to another sentient being is a wrongful act. do\nyou really not see how protecting yourself could harm a person? when\nyou punch a person to keep them from continuing to punch you, is their\nbroken nose not harmful to them? i am not opposed to organization. i\nstand against \"authority\" or the \"right to rule over others\", when no\nsuch right, in fact exists. where are these previously agreed upon\nrules of conduct? and who came up with them? what are they? you don't\nstand against your right to rule against trespasser in your house.\nlaws are the previously agreed on rules. legislators came up with\nthem. the vast cast majority of them concern the protection of people\nand property. here is reference to a small area in italy that held\ntheir independence from 1440 to 1826:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nrepublic ofcospaia this is probably your best bet. a small commune of\nlike minded people can accomplish all kinds of things that a larger\nsociety cannot. communism has functioned to varying degrees in\ncommunes. that doesn't make it a good model for society. which is why\nmy challenge was to present a large integrated society. in cospaia,\nthey relied on a \"council of elders and heads of families\" which\n\"decided with whom the members of the families would associate\npersonally and in business\". they didn't use threat of violence, but\nfamily pressure. i saw the godfather, but other then that i don't know\nwhat \"family pressure\" looks like in italy. anyway, good for them.\nproviding a commodity that your larger neighbors want, but is banned\nis a nice way to stay in business when you're too small to stave off\nmilitary invasion. you discounted zomia, and it does not say anything\nabout \"violent enforcement of values\" which is what the state does.\nzomia has some cultures that limit the amount of wealth and power\nyou're allowed to display. some further reading on zomia shows that\nmost of what is out there comes from an author named james scott, who\ncoined the name for the region. the area is composed of many different\ngroups of people living in small communities scattered across the\nregion. scott lumps them all together and puts every cultural artifact\nin terms of purposeful resistance to a state. he even claims their\nilliteracy is on purpose. if you want to know anything about the\npeople of this fabricated region of zomia, you have to look at each\nculture. a glance at hmong people in asia indicates that a woman may\nbe better off staying with her highly abusive husband because\ncommunity backlash against divorce would be worse for her. the karen\npeople aren't avoiding the state, they just keep losing when they try\nto form one. they occasionally have charismatic leaders rule over\nlarge enough groups to go fight the government and then they are\nsmashed to bits and scatter back to the hills. zomia could be\nanalogous to appalachia. where people don't like the government and\nhandle things themselves. where literacy is low and substance abuse\nand violence are high. some cultures in zomia probably have their own\nhatfields and mccoys. well now, my first property that i own is my\nbody. so, i guess, by your logic, my very existence restricts other's\nfreedom. there is a distinct difference between you and things. you\nare you. you own things. a person can infringe on your property rights\nwithout you even being present. this is not so with your person. as\nsuch, your ownership of yourself is distinct from your ownership of\ninanimate property. for you to even claim ownership of inanimate\nproperty as you claim ownership of yourself requires commonly accepted\nrules. many (most?) supposedly anarchic societies disregard your\nconception of ownership of inanimate things. your rules about property\ndon't apply to them. if you attempt to make them apply, you restrict\nfreedom. to those who disregard inanimate property rights, the\ntrespasser has the right to physically defend himself against your\nviolent aggression when you attempt to remove him from your couch. i\nsay \"capitalism\" can actually thrive when freedom is maximized. the\nbest way for that to occur is under voluntary conditions. this negates\nthe state. you say it, but it's not unsupportable. do you know what\ncheckers is without ground rules? cardboard and rubbish. there is no\ngame. government provides the rules of trade for capitalism. rules\naren't rules if they are not enforceable. rules are inconsistent and\nunpredictable if they are enforced by each person in each instance as\neach feels it should be at the time. laws make rules consistent and\npredictable. laws create an objective standard, rather than the pure\nsubjectivism of \"anarcho-capitalism\". i didn't say it would. but it\nwould reduce it down to a much lesser degree than what we have now,\nwith government. a baseless assertion. as nation states have grown in\ncomplexity and efficiency of enforcement, violence between individuals\nand groups has plummeted. archeological research shows that pre-modern\nlife, where people lives in small tribes, was exceedingly violent.\nlife was too often nasty, brutish and short. and the trespasser is not\ninnocent if he is trespassing or trying to steal my property. i would\nbe stopping him from doing this. he initiated the use of force when he\ntrespassed and tried to steal my things or do harm to me or mine.\nyou're making up property rights to assert a right to rule over the so\ncalled trespasser. if all is actually anarchy, then\ud83c\udfb5 this land is your\nland, this land is my land\ud83c\udfb5. if you kick me out of the house and call\nit yours, you are initiating force, and i the trespasser am defending\nmyself. if anarchy is reality, then property rights are as meaningful\nas the fiat currency you used to acquire your supposed property. a\nfree voluntary stateless society does not mean volunteer. voluntary\ninteractions amongst each other, without anyone forcing others to do\ntheir bidding against their will. that's utopic. people do force\nthings on others. without a state, there is no due process to deal\nwith such people. so the minute someone does what people often do,\nvictimize another, you have no recourse but a completely subjective\nsense of retribution, possibly against the wrong person. so, what\nhappens when people start to withdraw support for the state of that\nlarge, complex society. is it going to force everyone stay under it's\nthumb? it depends on what you mean by withdrawal. people take off to\nalaska, siberia, or even rural colorado. no one care. others choose to\nset up a criminal enterprise for not only elicit substances, but human\ntrafficking (prostitution), dog fighting, murder for hire, and a host\nof other harmless endeavors deemed \"wrong\" by the government. those\nkinds of dissenters are hunted and put in cages. most people are glad\nfor it. it is not necessary, no matter how large a given population\nis. people can and do work things out amongst themselves. we are\nindividuals, not a collective like a behive. we are not the borg.\npeople can and do work most things out amongst themselves in the us\ntoday. and other people victimize people. the violent criminal cannot\nbe addressed by folks working things out with each

sought. i'm glad we aren't.\nthere are far more prohibitive laws on the books than there are to do\nwith evil acts or ones that do harm. most criminal law refers to\nproperty crime and violent crime. if you threw out all drug\nprohibitions today, you would leave most of our criminal laws in tact.\nif i am not mistaken, it was the obamacare act. it made it a\nrequirement to get health insurance or be penalized by the irs. trump\nmight have done a way with that part, but now biden is in there; it\nchanges with their whims. and if you don't get health insurance, you\npay at tax time. the only way

with a means to resolve such issues. \"political\nauthority\" or government will not do this, but will make matters\nworse. there is the free market and there is property rights in a free\nsociety, i.e. stateless one or no centralized political authority. the\nonly property rights in a stateless society are those that you can\nsecure with your own threat of violence. just like the trespasser in\nyour house. the existence of property rights negate absolute freedom.\nas i have explained, your enforcement of property rights limits the\nfreedom of another to use said property. political authority has\nhistorically made property disputes resolvable so efficiently and\npeacefully that we are now able to enjoy the large and complex modern\nsociety that no commune or stateless backwater can produce. that's why\npeople won't walk away from society. they are better off staying. but\nmorality must be recognized and adhered to, in order for freedom to be\nmaximized. anarchy reigns, regardless. when i say that \"no one has a\nright to rule over others\" that means that right does not exist.\nultimately, no has control over anybody, but themselves. and to try to\ntake that control from someone else is wrong, and flatout evil. yet\nthat's exactly what you do with the trespasser. calling your property\nnan extension of yourself does not actually make you and your property\nthe same thing. it merely makes your actions against the free movement\nof another seem justified to you. the trespasser can use your same\nposition to justify self-defense against you on property that he does\nnot believe nyoi can call your own. natural law doesn't. but man's\nlaws do. if you write down an explicit example of natural law, and\nthen write down the consequences for breaching it, you have created\nman's law. in fact, the only difference between natural law and man's\nlaw is the difference between laws you personally like and laws you\ndon't. furthermore, laws are fundamentally

when it necessarily restricts the\nfreedom of others? what is the consequence for breaching that right?\nsince government can be used for evil, you advocate it's elimination.\nbut freedom can be used for evil, so why argue for it's maximization?\nthe rest of what you describe, i would agree with except the last\npart. what they have done there is the miss use of freedom. it does\nnot show it to be

manner that is a problem for you, and you are restricting\nhis freedom as a result. if freedom can be used for evil (it can),\nthen it is not inherently good. it should be upheld where it is good\nand restricted where it is not, such as when you restrict the freedom\nof a trespasser. except that the governments of this planet have\nbecome the biggest criminal gangs and do exactly what you

also avoided my\nentire point about turf wars. i presented the irrational economic\nreasons, but bloody feuds arise for emotional reasons as well. a\ndisinterested third party with superior fire power suppresses such\nfeuds. so, is a grocery store a government? i mean there is no real\n\"authority\". there are leadership roles, but that is not the same as a\nruler. everyone in that vast and complex network is operating\nvoluntarily, of their own free-will. no one is forcing them to work\nthere. if an employee breaks the rules that govern the business, the\nowner or manager may dock pay, or force the employee to leave against\ntheir will. the employee is no longer free to stay. they are your\ntrespasser. when jurisdictions are small, some governments do the very\nsame thing with banishment from their society. large jurisdictions\ndeport some, but banishment isn't much of an option. temporary\nbanishment into a jail has filled that role. is it centralized\n\"authority\"? do these groups, no matter the size get to tell others\nwho want nothing to do with their group that they must adhere to their\n\"rules\" or else? yes. there's always an \"or else\". you tell the\ntrespasser to leave your house \"or else\". the grocery tells employees\nto do their job in this or that way \"or else\". social pressure carries\nwith it a host of implied \"or else\". this is what i talked about\nearlier. people coerce others and restrict freedom in a whole host of\nways. no, government, by the root meaning of the word means \"to\ncontrol mind\". or mind control. the \"ment\" in

i said. this meaning of\n\"instrument/medium\" applies to other \"ment\" words such as\nestablishment, management, compartment, etc. again the etymology is\nfrom \"mentum\", not \"mente\". but i have not said that there would be no\nconflict. what i describe is certainly not that. there will always be\nconflicts. the trick is to find ways to resolve them. this is why i\nsaid that even your conflicts are resolved through inexplicable\nagreement. most of the time people can work through disagreements.\nthis is because there is some larger principal that is agreed on. some\ncommon value appealed to by both. less commonly, though still\nprevalent, is the situation where conflicts cannot be resolved through\ncommon value. the only outcome here is force (through coercion or\nbarrier). either one party will be forced to leave without their value\nbeing achieved, or they will force the acquisition of their value from\nthe opposing party. so, did you ever read utopia? and you say that as\nif we should not try for it. i am not interested in the kind of\nsociety thomas more presented. likely neither are you. but we have to\nlive around each other. or else what? we do not have to live around\nothers. there are still empty places an unsociable person can choose\nto go. but if we choose to live around each other, we are going to be\nsubjected to consequences. others will always present soft and hard\nforms of limitations on freedom. soft forms are encountered all the\ntime with human interaction. hard forms are laws, and they aren't\ngoing anywhere either.",
                " that does not mean that all governments will do so. but some\ngovernments have and will. do you honestly expect that if the us were\nto reduce its number of guns held by private individuals, to levels\nsimilar to most of europe for example, the government would start\nsystematically assassinating its population? doesn't matter. they will\nsimply be able to do so if they ever wished to. recently obama signed\nhimself the ability to order drone strikes against american citizens\nwithout due process. the more armed the populace, the more we can\nfight back if/when necessary. because tens of thousands of people die\nevery year to guns, for certain. they also die from knives, automobile\naccidents, baseball bats, poisoning, bombings, etc. reducing the\nnumber of guns in society (say from 88 per 100 people, to maybe below\n5) would save hundreds of thousands of people over the years. no\nevidence of either claims (reduction of guns and/or homicides). in\nfact, there is evidence to the contrary . either way, asking\ngovernment to take guns away by using guns is elitist. you trust a few\npeople with power over all people with equal power. because people\ndon't want to live in a society where they need the capacity to kill\nothers in order for them to feel safe for women who are victims of\nsexual abuse, that is a reality regardless of gun laws. access towards\nguns just makes it easier for them to level the playing field. further\nperpetuating a sense of mutual mistrust and social miscohesion you\nhave a very misinformed pov of people who own guns. trust me, they're\nnot paranoid loons constantly looking over their shoulder. part of\nthat is because they already feel secure as a gun owner. because guns\ngive people power which they should not have, make it easier to commit\nattrocious acts, and reduce the effective freedoms of individuals yes,\nso i suppose we can trust the people in government aren't the same\nkind of people that you're speaking of. we live in a world where guns\nare used to kill other people intentionally yes, lots of cops and\nsoldiers do that quite sufficiently when the civilians can't fight\nback. where guns kill people accidentally extremely rare i don't want\nto live in a society like that, and i don't think it would benefit\nanyone, only lead to a world of brutality. having rights doesn't\nequate chaotic anarchy. people don't just kill people because they\nhave a right to own something. they kill people often when they feel\noppressed, or depressed. so if you're really worried about such a\nhypothetical world that you've provided no evidence for, i propose\npsychology. plus, i'm very upset that the government can carry around\nall of these tanks and explosives and just shoot up an entire village\nof people. so once again, i think your actual fear should be of\ngovernment power. but what better system is there? no system. just let\nthe people be free and protect themselves. it's much better than\nallowing for a small group of people to have power over everyone else.\nthat is where the atrocities come from. a small group of people have\nalmost no power when everyone else is just as armed as them.\natrocities are less likely; and the people police their own\ncommunities. who better to have that than the people we choose to lead\nus i didn't vote in the cops or the soldiers. i voted for gary\njohnson, he didn't get elected. instead i have obama, who's totally\nfine with killing innocent american citizens without due process. this\ndemocracy stuff you speak of is overrated. it hasn't kept war-mongers\nout of office (bush, clinton, obama). so no, i don't trust the people\nthat others have chosen to have power. that supposedly operate in a\ntransparent system transparent when wikileaks exposes their lunacy.\nand what happens? wikileaks is viewed as a villain, and the people\nwatching the media just agree. to people who are under no form of\ncontrol, who can do whatever they want you mean members of the\ngovernment. tell me, how many drone strikes in pakistan have any of us\nbeen able to stop? who are we holding accountable? not a god damn\nsoul."

                " the more it gets involved in services that had been or are provided\nby the private sector the worse that market gets. that depends. while\nmany things are better left to the market, that market exists within a\nlarger framework provided by government. the market cannot itself\nprovide that framework because that framework necessarily relies on a\nmonopoly on the initiation of force independent of market forces such\nas profit. the government does things it shouldn't. it does not follow\nfrom that fact that the government shouldn't do anything. no it is\nnot. no one should have a monopoly on these things...so, the truth is\nthat it is a monopoly on violence. something no one has a right to do\nto anyone else. that's not true. and if my family is killed, i have\nthe right to seek justice with the means i have available. if that\nmeans i go after the killer myself, then, i will do so. the person you\nbelieve is the killer has a right to due process. that process is\nnecessarily a legal process. that's why you don't have the right to\ntake it upon yourself. if there's no government, then there's no\npossibility for due process. in that case, you and anyone else can\nseek retribution against whomever you believe is guilty for whatever\nreason. and we would all be much worse off. and you are calling it a\nlegal institution, yet it is private. so, what do you mean when you\nsay \"legal institution\"? is it private, public, or do you see no\ndifference? that's my mistake. they are building an institution where\nlegal institutions are weak. of there were no legal institutions,\npeople would create them. no, the cop follows orders. one definition\nof profit is a valuable return, not necessarily money. it could\nsomething akin to human resources in the form of more prisoners for\nhuman labor. private prisons thrive on this. cops aren't allowed to\njust follow orders. when an illegal order is followed, they get sued\nand fired and sometimes imprisoned. cops follows laws and policies.\norders must be within law and policy for a cop to claim they were\njustified in acting on the order. politicians, for example, would be\nconsidered ruling class. anyone can become a politician and the claim\nis through the actions and operations of these people. do you mean the\nprocess of legislation? enforcement? judicial operations? as for\n\"ruling over other's ability to enter my property\" i have covered this\nalready. i am not ruling over anyone. claiming such a right is the\nsame as enslaving someone. i have not done this with the protection of\nmy home and family, or myself. you are limiting a trespassers freedom\nwith barriers and, if that barrier is breached, you are using violence\nor the threat of violence to remove them (coercion). you are claiming\nthe right to do so. when you explain that it is your right to do so,\nyou aren't negating the fact that this is what you're doing. it is\nabsolutely different. did you read what i said? if the act does no\nharm to others, then, it is a right action. that's not true. an action\ncan cause no harm to others and still be wrong. i described nothing\nabout the trespasser that implies harm to you or your family. the\nperson is merely where you don't want them to be. how are you acting\ndifferent from government? as i pointed out above they tell me and\neveryone else how to live their lives, what they can or cannot do with\ntheir bodies, etc. you tell the trespasser what he cannot do, then you\nphysically enforce it if they disobey. the government has a law that\nsays they will punish you for assaulting someone. they will punish you\nis a predetermined way in accordance with predetermined rules and only\nafter you're granted due process. but to you, this is out of bounds.\nit's far better than your alternative. i have a right to protect my\nhome , family, and myself from harm. that is, it is a right action,\nthat does no harm to anyone else in doing so. you're claiming that\nright. but you perceive harm in a trespasser where the trespasser\nperceived no harm. are you really going to keep this stranger from\nfinishing his 6 pack on your couch? will you initiate violence against\nhim to see home off your property? this is the same as anyone has the\nright to do. it is not what i call a wrongful act, it is the truth. an\nact that causes harm to another sentient being is a wrongful act. do\nyou really not see how protecting yourself could harm a person? when\nyou punch a person to keep them from continuing to punch you, is their\nbroken nose not harmful to them? i am not opposed to organization. i\nstand against \"authority\" or the \"right to rule over others\", when no\nsuch right, in fact exists. where are these previously agreed upon\nrules of conduct? and who came up with them? what are they? you don't\nstand against your right to rule against trespasser in your house.\nlaws are the previously agreed on rules. legislators came up with\nthem. the vast cast majority of them concern the protection of people\nand property. here is reference to a small area in italy that held\ntheir independence from 1440 to 1826:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nrepublic ofcospaia this is probably your best bet. a small commune of\nlike minded people can accomplish all kinds of things that a larger\nsociety cannot. communism has functioned to varying degrees in\ncommunes. that doesn't make it a good model for society. which is why\nmy challenge was to present a large integrated society. in cospaia,\nthey relied on a \"council of elders and heads of families\" which\n\"decided with whom the members of the families would associate\npersonally and in business\". they didn't use threat of violence, but\nfamily pressure. i saw the godfather, but other then that i don't know\nwhat \"family pressure\" looks like in italy. anyway, good for them.\nproviding a commodity that your larger neighbors want, but is banned\nis a nice way to stay in business when you're too small to stave off\nmilitary invasion. you discounted zomia, and it does not say anything\nabout \"violent enforcement of values\" which is what the state does.\nzomia has some cultures that limit the amount of wealth and power\nyou're allowed to display. some further reading on zomia shows that\nmost of what is out there comes from an author named james scott, who\ncoined the name for the region. the area is composed of many different\ngroups of people living in small communities scattered across the\nregion. scott lumps them all together and puts every cultural artifact\nin terms of purposeful resistance to a state. he even claims their\nilliteracy is on purpose. if you want to know anything about the\npeople of this fabricated region of zomia, you have to look at each\nculture. a glance at hmong people in asia indicates that a woman may\nbe better off staying with her highly abusive husband because\ncommunity backlash against divorce would be worse for her. the karen\npeople aren't avoiding the state, they just keep losing when they try\nto form one. they occasionally have charismatic leaders rule over\nlarge enough groups to go fight the government and then they are\nsmashed to bits and scatter back to the hills. zomia could be\nanalogous to appalachia. where people don't like the government and\nhandle things themselves. where literacy is low and substance abuse\nand violence are high. some cultures in zomia probably have their own\nhatfields and mccoys. well now, my first property that i own is my\nbody. so, i guess, by your logic, my very existence restricts other's\nfreedom. there is a distinct difference between you and things. you\nare you. you own things. a person can infringe on your property rights\nwithout you even being present. this is not so with your person. as\nsuch, your ownership of yourself is distinct from your ownership of\ninanimate property. for you to even claim ownership of inanimate\nproperty as you claim ownership of yourself requires commonly accepted\nrules. many (most?) supposedly anarchic societies disregard your\nconception of ownership of inanimate things. your rules about property\ndon't apply to them. if you attempt to make them apply, you restrict\nfreedom. to those who disregard inanimate property rights, the\ntrespasser has the right to physically defend himself against your\nviolent aggression when you attempt to remove him from your couch. i\nsay \"capitalism\" can actually thrive when freedom is maximized. the\nbest way for that to occur is under voluntary conditions. this negates\nthe state. you say it, but it's not unsupportable. do you know what\ncheckers is without ground rules? cardboard and rubbish. there is no\ngame. government provides the rules of trade for capitalism. rules\naren't rules if they are not enforceable. rules are inconsistent and\nunpredictable if they are enforced by each person in each instance as\neach feels it should be at the time. laws make rules consistent and\npredictable. laws create an objective standard, rather than the pure\nsubjectivism of \"anarcho-capitalism\". i didn't say it would. but it\nwould reduce it down to a much lesser degree than what we have now,\nwith government. a baseless assertion. as nation states have grown in\ncomplexity and efficiency of enforcement, violence between individuals\nand groups has plummeted. archeological research shows that pre-modern\nlife, where people lives in small tribes, was exceedingly violent.\nlife was too often nasty, brutish and short. and the trespasser is not\ninnocent if he is trespassing or trying to steal my property. i would\nbe stopping him from doing this. he initiated the use of force when he\ntrespassed and tried to steal my things or do harm to me or mine.\nyou're making up property rights to assert a right to rule over the so\ncalled trespasser. if all is actually anarchy, then\ud83c\udfb5 this land is your\nland, this land is my land\ud83c\udfb5. if you kick me out of the house and call\nit yours, you are initiating force, and i the trespasser am defending\nmyself. if anarchy is reality, then property rights are as meaningful\nas the fiat currency you used to acquire your supposed property. a\nfree voluntary stateless society does not mean volunteer. voluntary\ninteractions amongst each other, without anyone forcing others to do\ntheir bidding against their will. that's utopic. people do force\nthings on others. without a state, there is no due process to deal\nwith such people. so the minute someone does what people often do,\nvictimize another, you have no recourse but a completely subjective\nsense of retribution, possibly against the wrong person. so, what\nhappens when people start to withdraw support for the state of that\nlarge, complex society. is it going to force everyone stay under it's\nthumb? it depends on what you mean by withdrawal. people take off to\nalaska, siberia, or even rural colorado. no one care. others choose to\nset up a criminal enterprise for not only elicit substances, but human\ntrafficking (prostitution), dog fighting, murder for hire, and a host\nof other harmless endeavors deemed \"wrong\" by the government. those\nkinds of dissenters are hunted and put in cages. most people are glad\nfor it. it is not necessary, no matter how large a given population\nis. people can and do work things out amongst themselves. we are\nindividuals, not a collective like a behive. we are not the borg.\npeople can and do work most things out amongst themselves in the us\ntoday. and other people victimize people. the violent criminal cannot\nbe addressed by folks working things out with each individual case.\nthey must be addressed through due process, which is necessarily\ngovernmental. the alternative is the mob and vigilantism. both of\nwhich require only the emotional impulses of the vengeance seekers.\nyeah, they should have obeyed authority er the law. those laws should\nnot be in place, to begin with. if there is no victim, there is no\ncrime. again, the point is that laws are

                " the more it gets involved in services that had been or are provided\nby the private sector the worse that market gets. that depends. while\nmany things are better left to the market, that market exists within a\nlarger framework provided by government. the market cannot itself\nprovide that framework because that framework necessarily relies on a\nmonopoly on the initiation of force independent of market forces such\nas profit. the government does things it shouldn't. it does not follow\nfrom that fact that the government shouldn't do anything. no it is\nnot. no one should have a monopoly on these things...so, the truth is\nthat it is a monopoly on violence. something no one has a right to do\nto anyone else. that's not true. and if my family is killed, i have\nthe right to seek justice with the means i have available. if that\nmeans i go after the killer myself, then, i will do so. the person you\nbelieve is the killer has a right to due process. that process is\nnecessarily a legal process. that's why you don't have the right to\ntake it upon yourself. if there's no government, then there's no\npossibility for due process. in that case, you and anyone else can\nseek retribution against whomever you believe is guilty for whatever\nreason. and we would all be much worse off. and you are calling it a\nlegal institution, yet it is private. so, what do you mean when you\nsay \"legal institution\"? is it private, public, or do you see no\ndifference? that's my mistake. they are building an institution where\nlegal institutions are weak. of there were no legal institutions,\npeople would create them. no, the cop follows orders. one definition\nof profit is a valuable return, not necessarily money. it could\nsomething akin to human resources in the form of more prisoners for\nhuman labor. private prisons thrive on this. cops aren't allowed to\njust follow orders. when an illegal order is followed, they get sued\nand fired and sometimes imprisoned. cops follows laws and policies.\norders must be within law and policy for a cop to claim they were\njustified in acting on the order. politicians, for example, would be\nconsidered ruling class. anyone can become a politician and the claim\nis through the actions and operations of these people. do you mean the\nprocess of legislation? enforcement? judicial operations? as for\n\"ruling over other's ability to enter my property\" i have covered this\nalready. i am not ruling over anyone. claiming such a right is the\nsame as enslaving someone. i have not done this with the protection of\nmy home and family, or myself. you are limiting a trespassers freedom\nwith barriers and, if that barrier is breached, you are using violence\nor the threat of violence to remove them (coercion). you are claiming\nthe right to do so. when you explain that it is your right to do so,\nyou aren't negating the fact that this is what you're doing. it is\nabsolutely different. did you read what i said? if the act does no\nharm to others, then, it is a right action. that's not true. an action\ncan cause no harm to others and still be wrong. i described nothing\nabout the trespasser that implies harm to you or your family. the\nperson is merely where you don't want them to be. how are you acting\ndifferent from government? as i pointed out above they tell me and\neveryone else how to live their lives, what they can or cannot do with\ntheir bodies, etc. you tell the trespasser what he cannot do, then you\nphysically enforce it if they disobey. the government has a law that\nsays they will punish you for assaulting someone. they will punish you\nis a predetermined way in accordance with predetermined rules and only\nafter you're granted due process. but to you, this is out of bounds.\nit's far better than your alternative. i have a right to protect my\nhome , family, and myself from harm. that is, it is a right action,\nthat does no harm to anyone else in doing so. you're claiming that\nright. but you perceive harm in a trespasser where the trespasser\nperceived no harm. are you really going to keep this stranger from\nfinishing his 6 pack on your couch? will you initiate violence against\nhim to see home off your property? this is the same as anyone has the\nright to do. it is not what i call a wrongful act, it is the truth. an\nact that causes harm to another sentient being is a wrongful act. do\nyou really not see how protecting yourself could harm a person? when\nyou punch a person to keep them from continuing to punch you, is their\nbroken nose not harmful to them? i am not opposed to organization. i\nstand against \"authority\" or the \"right to rule over others\", when no\nsuch right, in fact exists. where are these previously agreed upon\nrules of conduct? and who came up with them? what are they? you don't\nstand against your right to rule against trespasser in your house.\nlaws are the previously agreed on rules. legislators came up with\nthem. the vast cast majority of them concern the protection of people\nand property. here is reference to a small area in italy that held\ntheir independence from 1440 to 1826:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nrepublic ofcospaia this is probably your best bet. a small commune of\nlike minded people can accomplish all kinds of things that a larger\nsociety cannot. communism has functioned to varying degrees in\ncommunes. that doesn't make it a good model for society. which is why\nmy challenge was to present a large integrated society. in cospaia,\nthey relied on a \"council of elders and heads of families\" which\n\"decided with whom the members of the families would associate\npersonally and in business\". they didn't use threat of violence, but\nfamily pressure. i saw the godfather, but other then that i don't know\nwhat \"family pressure\" looks like in italy. anyway, good for them.\nproviding a commodity that your larger neighbors want, but is banned\nis a nice way to stay in business when you're too small to stave off\nmilitary invasion. you discounted zomia, and it does not say anything\nabout \"violent enforcement of values\" which is what the state does.\nzomia has some cultures that limit the amount of wealth and power\nyou're allowed to display. some further reading on zomia shows that\nmost of what is out there comes from an author named james scott, who\ncoined the name for the region. the area is composed of many different\ngroups of people living in small communities scattered across the\nregion. scott lumps them all together and puts every cultural artifact\nin terms of purposeful resistance to a state. he even claims their\nilliteracy is on purpose. if you want to know anything about the\npeople of this fabricated region of zomia, you have to look at each\nculture. a glance at hmong people in asia indicates that a woman may\nbe better off staying with her highly abusive husband because\ncommunity backlash against divorce would be worse for her. the karen\npeople aren't avoiding the state, they just keep losing when they try\nto form one. they occasionally have charismatic leaders rule over\nlarge enough groups to go fight the government and then they are\nsmashed to bits and scatter back to the hills. zomia could be\nanalogous to appalachia. where people don't like the government and\nhandle things themselves. where literacy is low and substance abuse\nand violence are high. some cultures in zomia probably have their own\nhatfields and mccoys. well now, my first property that i own is my\nbody. so, i guess, by your logic, my very existence restricts other's\nfreedom. there is a distinct difference between you and things. you\nare you. you own things. a person can infringe on your property rights\nwithout you even being present. this is not so with your person. as\nsuch, your ownership of yourself is distinct from your ownership of\ninanimate property. for you to even claim ownership of inanimate\nproperty as you claim ownership of yourself requires commonly accepted\nrules. many (most?) supposedly anarchic societies disregard your\nconception of ownership of inanimate things. your rules about property\ndon't apply to them. if you attempt to make them apply, you restrict\nfreedom. to those who disregard inanimate property rights, the\ntrespasser has the right to physically defend himself against your\nviolent aggression when you attempt to remove him from your couch. i\nsay \"capitalism\" can actually thrive when freedom is maximized. the\nbest way for that to occur is under voluntary conditions. this negates\nthe state. you say it, but it's not unsupportable. do you know what\ncheckers is without ground rules? cardboard and rubbish. there is no\ngame. government provides the rules of trade for capitalism. rules\naren't rules if they are not enforceable. rules are inconsistent and\nunpredictable if they are enforced by each person in each instance as\neach feels it should be at the time. laws make rules consistent and\npredictable. laws create an objective standard, rather than the pure\nsubjectivism of \"anarcho-capitalism\". i didn't say it would. but it\nwould reduce it down to a much lesser degree than what we have now,\nwith government. a baseless assertion. as nation states have grown in\ncomplexity and efficiency of enforcement, violence between individuals\nand groups has plummeted. archeological research shows that pre-modern\nlife, where people lives in small tribes, was exceedingly violent.\nlife was too often nasty, brutish and short. and the trespasser is not\ninnocent if he is trespassing or trying to steal my property. i would\nbe stopping him from doing this. he initiated the use of force when he\ntrespassed and tried to steal my things or do harm to me or mine.\nyou're making up property rights to assert a right to rule over the so\ncalled trespasser. if all is actually anarchy, then\ud83c\udfb5 this land is your\nland, this land is my land\ud83c\udfb5. if you kick me out of the house and call\nit yours, you are initiating force, and i the trespasser am defending\nmyself. if anarchy is reality, then property rights are as meaningful\nas the fiat currency you used to acquire your supposed property. a\nfree voluntary stateless society does not mean volunteer. voluntary\ninteractions amongst each other, without anyone forcing others to do\ntheir bidding against their will. that's utopic. people do force\nthings on others. without a state, there is no due process to deal\nwith such people. so the minute someone does what people often do,\nvictimize another, you have no recourse but a completely subjective\nsense of retribution, possibly against the wrong person. so, what\nhappens when people start to withdraw support for the state of that\nlarge, complex society. is it going to force everyone stay under it's\nthumb? it depends on what you mean by withdrawal. people take off to\nalaska, siberia, or even rural colorado. no one care. others choose to\nset up a criminal enterprise for not only elicit substances, but human\ntrafficking (prostitution), dog fighting, murder for hire, and a host\nof other harmless endeavors deemed \"wrong\" by the government. those\nkinds of dissenters are hunted and put in cages. most people are glad\nfor it. it is not necessary, no matter how large a given population\nis. people can and do work things out amongst themselves. we are\nindividuals, not a collective like a behive. we are not the borg.\npeople can and do work most things out amongst themselves in the us\ntoday. and other people victimize people. the violent criminal cannot\nbe addressed by folks working things out with each individual case.\nthey must be addressed through due process, which is necessarily\ngovernmental. the alternative is the mob and vigilantism. both of\nwhich require only the emotional impulses of the vengeance seekers.\nyeah, they should have obeyed authority er the law. those laws should\nnot be in place, to begin with. if there is no victim, there is no\ncrime. again, the point is that laws are predictable and fairly\nconsistent over time. even bad laws. but it is. there are mounds of\nlaws, regulations and such on the books. you need a license to do just\nabout anything anymore. and a license means \"permission given for what\nis illegal\". you mentioned the communist manifesto. if you take a look\nat it's ten planks, almost if not all of them have been established\nhere in the u.s. your argument, that there are so many laws that no\none knows when they are breaking one, requires that you are unaware of\nevidence of your assertion. by naming those laws that you don't like,\nyou admit that you are aware of them. it is true that there are a\nsubstantial number of regulations on business. too many. these\nregulations do not result in unforeseen criminal charges for private\ncitizens nor for most companies. that's because people know what the\nlaws are. which is my point. it is almost never the case that people\nare charged for ignorance of their own illegal activity. and one has\nto stretch to see most of the ten planks in the us. income tax does\nnot mean we are all marxists now. and if we were, we would be that\nmuch closer to the stateless end marx sought. i'm glad we aren't.\nthere are far more prohibitive laws on the books than there are to do\nwith evil acts or ones that do harm. most criminal law refers to\nproperty crime and violent crime. if you threw out all drug\nprohibitions today, you would leave most of our criminal laws in tact.\nif i am not mistaken, it was the obamacare act. it made it a\nrequirement to get health insurance or be penalized by the irs. trump\nmight have done a way with that part, but now biden is in there; it\nchanges with their whims. and if you don't get health insurance, you\npay at tax time. the only way they could make it constitutional was to\nmake it a tax. as much as that is bullshit, it's not a substantial\nchange. money at tax time is par for the course. people can and do\norganize and come up with a means to resolve such issues. \"political\nauthority\" or government will not do this, but will make matters\nworse. there is the free market and there is property rights in a free\nsociety, i.e. stateless one or no centralized political authority. the\nonly property rights in a stateless society are those that you can\nsecure with your own threat of violence. just like the trespasser in\nyour house. the existence of property rights negate absolute freedom.\nas i have explained, your enforcement of property rights limits the\nfreedom of another to use said property. political authority has\nhistorically made property disputes resolvable so efficiently and\npeacefully that we are now able to enjoy the large and complex modern\nsociety that no commune or stateless backwater can produce. that's why\npeople won't walk away from society. they are better off staying. but\nmorality must be recognized and adhered to, in order for freedom to be\nmaximized. anarchy reigns, regardless. when i say that \"no one has a\nright to rule over others\" that means that right does not exist.\nultimately, no has control over anybody, but themselves. and to try to\ntake that control from someone else is wrong, and flatout evil. yet\nthat's exactly what you do with the trespasser. calling your property\nnan extension of yourself does not actually make you and your property\nthe same thing. it merely makes your actions against the free movement\nof another seem justified to you. the trespasser can use your same\nposition to justify self-defense against you on property that he does\nnot believe nyoi can call your own. natural law doesn't. but man's\nlaws do. if you write down an explicit example of natural law, and\nthen write down the consequences for breaching it, you have created\nman's law. in fact, the only difference between natural law and man's\nlaw is the difference between laws you personally like and laws you\ndon't. furthermore, laws are fundamentally statements of consequences,\nnot merely dictates. what is an example of natural law? what is the\nconsequence for the crime you would list? is inanimate property\nownership a right under natural law when it necessarily restricts the\nfreedom of others? what is the consequence for breaching that right?\nsince government can be used for evil, you advocate it's elimination.\nbut freedom can be used for evil, so why argue for it's maximization?\nthe rest of what you describe, i would agree with except the last\npart. what they have done there is the miss use of freedom. it does\nnot show it to be inherently, not good. it is an attempt to abuse\nothers. that is not freedom. it is freedom. you just dislike it. if\nyou agree with my definition, then the trespasser is simply using\nfreedom in a manner that is a problem for you, and you are restricting\nhis freedom as a result. if freedom can be used for evil (it can),\nthen it is not inherently good. it should be upheld where it is good\nand restricted where it is not, such as when you restrict the freedom\nof a trespasser. except that the governments of this planet have\nbecome the biggest criminal gangs and do exactly what you describe.\nthe u.s. being one of the biggest. drugs should not be legalized, they\nshould be decriminalized. not the same thing. this is another\nunsupported argument that begs the question. you've also avoided my\nentire point about turf wars. i presented the irrational economic\nreasons, but bloody feuds arise for emotional reasons as well. a\ndisinterested third party with superior fire power suppresses such\nfeuds. so, is a grocery store a government? i mean there is no real\n\"authority\". there are leadership roles, but that is not the same as a\nruler. everyone in that vast and complex network is operating\nvoluntarily, of their own free-will. no one is forcing them to work\nthere. if an employee breaks the rules that govern the business, the\nowner or manager may dock pay, or force the employee to leave against\ntheir will. the employee is no longer free to stay. they are your\ntrespasser. when jurisdictions are small, some governments do the very\nsame thing with banishment from their society. large jurisdictions\ndeport some, but banishment isn't much of an option. temporary\nbanishment into a jail has filled that role. is it centralized\n\"authority\"? do these groups, no matter the size get to tell others\nwho want nothing to do with their group that they must adhere to their\n\"rules\" or else? yes. there's always an \"or else\". you tell the\ntrespasser to leave your house \"or else\". the grocery tells employees\nto do their job in this or that way \"or else\". social pressure carries\nwith it a host of implied \"or else\". this is what i talked about\nearlier. people coerce others and restrict freedom in a whole host of\nways. no, government, by the root meaning of the word means \"to\ncontrol mind\". or mind control. the \"ment\" in government is not\nderived from the latin \"mente\" or mind. it is derived from the latin\n\"mentum\" or instrument/medium. government is the mechanism or\ninstrument by which behavior is governed, as i said. this meaning of\n\"instrument/medium\" applies to other \"ment\" words such as\nestablishment, management, compartment, etc. again the etymology is\nfrom \"mentum\", not \"mente\". but i have not said that there would be no\nconflict. what i describe is certainly not that. there will always be\nconflicts. the trick is to find ways to resolve them. this is why i\nsaid that even your conflicts are resolved through inexplicable\nagreement. most of the time people can work through disagreements.\nthis is because there is some larger principal that is agreed on. some\ncommon value appealed to by both. less commonly, though still\nprevalent, is the situation where conflicts cannot be resolved through\ncommon value. the only outcome here is force (through coercion or\nbarrier). either one party will be forced to leave without their value\nbeing achieved, or they will force the acquisition of their value from\nthe opposing party. so, did you ever read utopia? and you say that as\nif we should not try for it. i am not interested in the kind of\nsociety thomas more presented. likely neither are you. but we have to\nlive around each other. or else what? we do not have to live

                " here's the rest of it. perhaps bob barr.i know, i know, nobody wants\nto hear about third party candidates because \"they can't win.\" ross\nperot took a credible run at it, didn't he? can bob barr? this close\nin, perhaps not. but this doesn't mean we shouldn't try, and frankly,\nwhile you can argue over the other specifics of the libertarian's\npolicies (and i do, especially when it comes to foreign and energy\npolicies) without a functional economy there isn't anything else to\nworry about. bob barr's campaign is the only one to flat out say that\nthe fair tax is a reasonable alternative to what we have now, that\ncalls for accountability to congress for the federal reserve (and\nother monetary organs) and calls for reform of government spending in\na fashion that actually means something. is their platform perfect?\nno. as i said, there are points on which i disagree. but without an\neconomy, what else do we have?nothing.and unless john mccain changes\nhis tune, and fast, choosing either of the two \"main\" candidates will\nguarantee the destruction of our nation's economy.i sent a letter to\nmccain's headquarters, along with governors ridge and keating, this\nafternoon. i think everyone should read it. it lays forth the fact\nthat absent dramatic change - and calls for that change, explicitly -\njohn mccain has no chance in the election. none. zip. zero. nada.more\nalarmingly, that electoral map puts the democrats within one vote of a\nfilibuster-proof majority in congress.one vote.the wall street\nmeltdown is clearly fingered as the item that changed the electoral\nmap in ways that are, absent decisive action, unrecoverable. the time\nline does not lie.this is not, as you might imagine, the first letter\ni have sent to mccain's campaign. in fact i've lost count since i\nattended their \"rally\" in washington dc in late july. i have been\nworking like a banshee behind the scenes to try to get some common\nsense injected into his economic program, without success.no more\n\"behind the scenes\" - that letter is a small sample of what he's had\nlaid upon the table in front of him, and if the republican base (or\nany state coordinators who are tired of the bs coming from mccain's\ncampaign) want the rest of the letters, contact me. let there be no\nmistake made about it - mccain's campaign has had full and complete\ncommunication from me on this matter, as i identified him as having\nthe best shot at being willing to address these issues of the two\nmajor candidates.thus far, i have been wrong. we will see if that\nchanges, and if state republican coordinators and leaders have \"had\nenough\" and are willing to get off their duffs and demand that mr.\nmccain do something intelligent here, lest they walk off with their\nsupport and funding in the critical last month. after all, if mccain\nis going to ruin the economy (and so is barack) why not keep your\nmoney instead of giving it to john? if the democrats get a filibuster-\nproof majority in congress (which a month ago i would have said is\nfanciful - not any more!) then absolutely everything and anything that\nbarack obama wants, he will get. there will be nothing to stop it.if\nyou're a republican, if john mccain doesn't change course right now\nyou're gonna need every dime you have given what's to come. blowing it\non pointless campaign contributions is the idiot's move of the\ncentury. snap that wallet shut right now unless mccain gets off his\nduff and adopts something similar to what i've been\npropounding.seriously.full disclosure: i am an oldtime republican.\nvoted for george w bush twice and bush the elder. but never - and i do\nmean never - should you take from this that i think republicans and\ndemocrats do not bear equal responsibility for this mess, because they\ndo.this is not a partisan issue and those who strive to make it one\nare going to be responsible for making the mess worse, not\nbetter.there is no \"bipartisanship\" involved in solutions here, nor\n\"partisanship\". there are only non-partisan solutions to this\ncrisis.the facts of what we now face and the choices we either must\nmake or will be made for us:leverage must come out of the system and\nwill. we will get back to 12:1 or less one way or another. we can\neither do it under regulatory fiat, which is neutral and nails\neveryone, or we can do it in a disorderly fashion as mr. market\nimposes it upon us and wind up with a depression in the process. there\nare no other options;

                " \"so in effect, the only evidence you have is a war led by a different\nadministration, a poem, and a gut feeling\" in effect no, i have the\nentire history of us imperialism coupled with the behaviour of the\ncurrent administration i.e. on the brink of an illegal invasion into\nlibya under the fase pretence of humanitarianism in order to secure a\nstake in libyan oil. \"first of all, the vietnam war was not during\nobama's administration- a rather large hole in your evidence that the\nobama administration does not care for soldiers\" it was you who\ndecided to make this specifically about the obama administration, i\nclaimed that no american administration really cares all the much\nabout the troops as long as they are doing what they need them to do.\n\"however: the vietnam war was particularly difficult war on the\nsoldiers because veterans were very poorly received by the american\npublic.\" please dont try to lecture me on the vietnam war, i have been\nto the country twice in my lifetime each time for 3 months, while\nthere i visiitged many war sites, museums, the co chi tunnels etc.\netc. etc. etc. etc. etc., i have read two books on the subject, i have\nwatched many documentaries about, i have read numerous articles on it,\nthere really isnt a whole lot you can tell me that i havent already\nheard somewhere else, and i dont know what could make you think i was\nunaware that the veterans of the war were not well received whenb they\ncame home. \"in the iraq war (which was also not instigated by obama,\nbut he has failed to discontinue)\" yes after promising that he would\nsend the troops home, why do you think he has kept them over there, do\nyou think he cares that much about the security of the iraqis that he\nfeels obligated to do whatever he can, or could it possibly be that\nhis motivations are more self interested?? come on. the troops are\nstaying put because its profitable to have them there, and whether\ntheir security or the people of iraqs security is at risk that really\nis a secondary priority to mr. obama. \"which, according to vietnam\nvets, makes this operation far less terrible than the extreme,\nunrelated vietnam war which you ited.\" i admit this, but what you fail\nto realise is that they didnt care about the troops then and they dont\ncare about them now, i dont what would make you think this had changed\nassuming you agree that they didnt really care about them then. \"nd\nsoldier's lives are expendable in that they risk their life- not that\nthey are intended to die. they are not pawns in a game: each soldier\nis outfitted with a $4,000 suit of body armor to protect them.\" i know\nthis, what you're failing to realise if they are killed its just\ncollateral damage, these wars aren't about protecting america from\nanything, or protecting their security, therefore they are\nimperialistic, they are not justified in anyway and the fact that the\nheads of the american government are willing to sacrifice their troops\nin roder to further their own self interested agenda shows that they\nreally dont care all that much about them. \"if the obama\nadministration viewed soldiers as expendable, they would not place\nbody armor that keeps soldiers alive. the cost of compensation for a\ndeath is under $1,200 per month, comparable to the 70% disability\nrating of the soldier.\" this proves nothing, i could equally say that\nthey place body armor on them as they dont wat to pay for his death or\ndisability \"so why would a government that views its soldiers as\nexpendable pay more if they are wounded than dead, and provide them\nwith body armor that increases the likelihood that they are kept\nalive?\" look you're going way to far with this, yes they care if the\nsoldiers die, the fact is the more soldiers that die the more\nunpopular the war becomes at home if discontent rises they may have to\npull out, this and many other arguments can be used to explain the\nabove but the truth is there are may in power who nprobably do care\nabout the troops, the fact humanity is such that there is always\nsomeone with a conscience. i just dont beleive that overall the\nactions of the government are in th ebest interests of presevering the\nlives of the troops, if they were why would they have invaded iraq.\n\"admittedly, the us is not the greatest with money, but i would lean\ntowards \"value of human life\" over \"inability to economize\" i wouldnt\nin fact i find that nieve. \"2) this was considered to be \"an\nespecially dangerous operation\" by the senior administration official.\nconsidering osama died in a firefight, this is not difficult to\nbelieve.\" really? i think the latest reports have more or less proven\nthis to be completely fase. \"additionally, i recently read that osama\nwas originally asked to surrender- but instead he fired his own\nweapon. maybe i misread the quote..\" maybe you just like beleiving\nwashington propaganda. i dont take any of it seriously cause i know it\nto be a pack of lies, i read in order to scrutinise it, nothing more\nits factual content is always very limited.also, i think we both know\nat this stage that the above is complete horseshit. \"3) information\nwas actually recovered from osama's home. in fact, \"it is the largest\ncache of intelligence information gotten from a senior terrorist\"\" so\nwhat, what does this prove, he was a terrorist, we already knew that,\ni get the feeling that you really like enforcing the washington\npropaganda, if you're not american how did you become so captivated by\ntheir false ideal and corrupt ideology. \"of course, if it was all a\nconspiracy, then my evidence may be called into question. but i have\nno reason to believe it is a conspiracy, and you have no evidence to\nsway me.\" why are we not allowed to know the truth, do you think this\nis how your news shoiuld be delievered to you? come fucking on man\nstart asking a few questions. \"and are you talking about the mujahidin\nstingers? man, that was cryptic to decode. it made it marginally more\ndifficult to find evidence. the information is already out there. the\nstingers were \"given out like lollipops\" in a reemerging cold war.\nwhat information would you think they were hiding?

im a christian, and i dont think tatoos are a\nsin. others may, its their freedom to do so! born again religions, may\nnot judge where or why a person has tattoos, and likely wouldn't judge\ntheir tattos. they may have a story to tell, let them! a church i\nstepped into several years back in philly while handing out food and\nblankets with my church group refused to let me use their bathroom\nbecause i am a woman and was wearing pants. yhey may believe\ndifferently and are strict about other things that other churches are\nnot strict with. and it should be ok to believe either way, and i\ncould care less about what they believe, thats their business, my\nbeliefs are my business! tolerance, live and let live. i have a belly\nring, and one of my favorite people in the world is my baby, youngest\ndaughter, because she is sweet. she has a guage earing, and has had\npurple to teal hair since she was in jr high. wawa and starbucks won't\nhire her, because visually she has an unnatural color hair. but, there\nare plenty of jobs that will. so she chooses to keep her crazy colors,\nand work where they dont have an issue with it! many churches dont\nthink certain vices are sin, like smoking or social drinking. there\nare varying degrees of doctrines. thats why religious freedom is so\nimportant!!!! many sects if christianity are evem loose on sexual\npreference, most i know are strict. but it is not up to people, or\ngovernment, or courts to scruitinize anyone's beliefs including gays\nwho have religious beliefs that are inclusive of sexual orientaton,\nunless a real crime has been commited. just like freedom of speech of\nevery degree is protected! both speech and religious freedom are\npersonal expression regarding what they think and believe about\neverything that matters to them! disabilities are not a choice and\nbeing black isnt a choice either, although honestly, america needs to\nhead in a different direction where all people regardless of race, all\nare equaly protected, and not especially protected! protected classes\nshould be represented of all groups of people and found in every race\nand culture! such as disabilities, and religions, ages, and gender. i'\nll explain: religion because it effects all races, genders, classes,\nand found in every walk of life. every religion from christian to\nmuslim to jews etc, and also religions that are permissive, and are\ninclusive of gay membership and leadership should have religious\nfreedom. does it mean we won' t bump into each other at times, but how\nabout we behave politely and say excuse me! or ok discussed agree to\ndisagree! isnt that what a \"progressive\" society is all about!\ndisabilities protected because they need to compete according to the\nabilities they do have. and people with disabilities are present in\nevery group. and age, because they have to compete against younger\ncandidates, and again age is a factor for every group so it is\nselective of none. and women, because they need to compete equally\nagainst men who have different strengths, and women need to be able to\ncompete according to their strengths, and not limited by the\nweaknesses they may present in a workplace, physically, or even\nregards to future pregnancies, birth, maternity leaves, sick kids, and\nother family responsibilities that could cause bias or expense of down\ntime or added health insurance costs. up till recently health\ninsurances have been higher because of reproduction. an example are\nthe nuns who recently fought cost of health insurance inclusive of\nreproductive ability. and they are abstinent, (except for some who\nchange their mind and take directions leading out of the vocation) the\nfollowing groups of classes are across the board represented in every\nsingle group of race and culture. so american 1st! america is multi\ncultural so every culture should be protected classes - american 1st,\nand white 2nd, italian 2nd, black 2nd, gay 2nd, married 2nd, single\n2nd, economic class 2nd. but in every american group of people, there\nare equally specific groups whovshould be protection from\ndiscrimination. and its reasonable, because it puts competing equal\nfor all in every group. but it can't be given above religious freedom\nof all, or its selective group breeching separation of church and\nstate because then it prohibits the free exercise of religion for all,\nexcept for 1 such as lgbt. sexual orientation should not be a\nprotected class. it's a lifestyle, and sexual choice. even if you\nbelieve it was genetic, every baby is born with the same option of\nchoice, and genetic or not can choose it. but in common every group\nhas: disabled, age, gender, and religion. we as a society should have\nmoved beyond the racial division to the next phase atleast 10 years\nago. not adding more divisions!! there will always be bullies, for\neveryone, in every group. reverse discrimination is just as much a\nproblem as discrimination!! the baker could even be an example of\nthis, she was signaled out in reverse discrimination, legally, for her\nbeliefs. yet not 1 case invoving muslims was brought forth even though\nthey believe the same. there is footage showing 3 muslim bakeries who\nalso would not make a cake against their own religious beliefs!\ndiscrimination for sexual orientation opens religions up for open\nhunting season as targets to be abused by anyone who is sexually\noriented protected. re: transgender bathroom laws: we were not likely\naware or able to notice transgenders in bathrooms. but creating laws,\nprotecting them in discriminations and allowing choice of bathrooms\nare also open hunting season by anyone who wants to exploit others,\nfor personal gain, political media attention, or both, and also for\npreditors. so if transgenders are really living like their identity,\nthen go in, close the door, and dont draw unneeded attention. and live\namd let live! if arrested, there is defense! you dont need a law for\nthat! bring your doctors report and it isnt an issue! maybe an\nexclusive allowance if identified could prevent problems instead of\ncreating them. nc didnt randomly make a law, they made it in response\nto extreme demands made by groups like lgbt! so be mad at them! the\nproblem is, special interest groups want to be special, superior,\nstand out, have special privelages, and allowances. they want to be\nable to control society, and discrimination laws are a license to\ncontrol and abuse others. they are only divisive, and cause unfairness\nto others resulting in further discrimination, and reverse\ndiscrimination! and this is the liberals play ground, the more\nproblems they create, the more it looks like you all need them! there\nwill always be hate crimes for everyone. fat, ugly, body shaming, gay,\nshort, black, white, spanish, asian etc. compete as americans, put\nthese divisive groups out! and we will be the america we intended to\nbe since 1776! religious freedom was and is inclusive of all. it is\nours by constitutional guarantee! society corrected many issues,\nspecial interest groups stop progress by extremes! now its time to\nmove past it all and simply be american. making some groups a\nprotected class, leaves others unprotected ex. the baker, florist, and\nthe marriage certificate clerk. all who should have had resposible\nsociety step in and protect them, and provide alternatives of other\nbusinesses, or signers. these exclusive special interest groups are\ndivisive. examples: making an excluse black statement, and forcing us\nto see you as black is counter productive. we dont want to \"have\" to\nlike you because you are black. we want to like you because you have\nintegrity, and you care about others, and you do a great job, and we\nwant to laugh and enjoy the fun things in your culture and celebrate\nour differences, like the fun we have with italian families, or the\ndrinking irish, or the fun we poke at the amish, or the fun we have\nwith gays, (who used to actually be enjoyed by communities, who are\nnow pissed off, thanks to lgbt!) or fun women drivers or \"hey you\nguys,\" or the formality of ladies and gentlemen. groups start for\ngood, but then when they arive to a point of growth and adjustments in\nsociety for further corrections, they go backward with extremes. such\nas feminist, good movement then extreme. black movement - good then\nextreme. when the extreme defines you, and now your group becomes\nselected for rights and freedoms, while the rest of society is forced\ninto giving theirs up, then you have gone from arrived, to going\nbackwards!!! i liked gays before this crap and after i now have trust\nissues, not because they are gay, but because of their activism. the\nextreme pushed your acceptance from general acceptance, even equal\nwithout discriminatory notice, to extreme overstepping into forced\nacceptance, then division and notice. you have to decide the goal, if\nyour goal is takeover, then your a jackass, and selfish, and un-\namerican! i grew up with alot of black friends, but when i went to a\ngrocery store and a few ignorant people decided that being black gave\nthem a right to walk through me, instead of equally being girls in a\ngrocery store, i was pissed! why because i dont like black people? or\nbecause i dont like people who want to force their will on me and\nbully me because they are black. now that was 30 years ago, why is\nthis more present, instead of history? because black people make being\nblack an issue, instead of making themselves equal, they want to\nenforce selective blackness, instead of celebrating blackness. same\ndeal w gays. we will never force change on people without creating\ndivisions and discrimination. even ben carson says, he grew up poor,\nworked hard and directed his life where he wanted. no one stopped him\nbecause he was black, and no one stopped him because he was poor. and\nhe didnt paint himself white or pretend he was white, or behave like\nhe was white. he embraced being american first, and being black 2nd.\nyet his own race call him names, uncle tom, playing the white game.\nnewsflash its not the white game he played, its the american game he\nplayed. there are some bad officers, but generally if white black\nspanish gay tatoo filled biker, or whatever, respect law enforcement,\nand if you respect them and they are still harsher than they should\nbe, sue them, or take them up the chain. but its not ok to wave your\narms around cuss the officer out, and appear threatening no matter who\nyou are, and as chris rock says, you probably wont get your ass\nkicked. but thats not what these groups want, and its not the messafe\nthey are giving to the people they claim to defend! instead they push\nthem further into the eye of the storm and divide society into the\ndiscrimination and into reverse discrimination hurting all of society\nincluding the people they say they are fighting for! most people feel\nlike i do, we are angry because we are being forced, and its divisive!\nim angry at groups like lbgt! and black lives matter! yet i have gay\nyoung adults at my house everyday! im angry because we have moved\nbeyond many things and these groups do the opposite of their supposed\nintention. we didnt even notice transgenders in our bathrooms till\nlgbt decided to make us notice! my daughter has a transgender friend\n(s)he is absolutely undetectable! we honestly wouldnt stare long\nenough to notice. so if you experience anger, thank lgbt. a same w\nblm! we want people to respect each others rights and share society.\nyou have bought some lies, christianity isnt your enemy, they are not\nbullying you. but also sexuality is a big deal to just about every\nreligion. and we have a right to believe what we want. and you do\nalso, if special interest groups would stop being bullies, we all\nwould be better off. we are a mixed up diverse group of americans! we\nlove ben carson, he is not black to anyone. i hate obama, black has\nnothing to do with it! the problem with the black special interest and\ngay special interest, isnt we dont like them! its we value being\namerican plain and simple ben carson, doesnt come out and say like me\nbecause i am black. he says like me because i am ben carson! the gay\nkids that come to my house dont say like me because i am gay, they say\nlike me because i am kind and a loyal friend, and i have value because\nof who i am, and also gay. not because i am gay i force you! divisive!\nread my letter to gays on this post, it applys to blm also! gay also\nhas sex attached, sex is morality. and everyone has a right to have a\nbelief and raise their children accordingly without influence forced\nupon their family and their values. exclusive laws to gain your\npersonal goals are acceptable. laws forced on all is not. i dont\nexpect everyone to like and agree with me, neiither should anyone\nelse. should the baker have to hire you, or bake a cake. well all\nshould be a protected class! she cant assume you are sexually in\nprivate offending god or her faith. as far as hiring every single\nperson should be able to sue if there is valid discrimination.\nexamples: i am 4'11\" italian considered caucasian, if i apply to the\nbaker and she hires an applicant with less crudentials, that should be\ninvestigated. as to why, what discrimination had her choose a less\nqualified applicant? if i am black same deal, but the black person and\nme should be on equal footing on possible discrimination. if i am gay,\nsame deal. she has no right to pry into privacy, privacy is a right.\nso when gays gain exclusive law, it wiuld be better to make their\nsexuality like hippa laws, a matter of choice and permission for a gay\nto share or not share their civil union status. and if she hires a\nlower quality applicant sue! but a wedding cake is different, because\nthats disclosure of sexuality in intent to marry, and that is her\nright to believe differently about family values, sexuality, and same\nsex marriage. so turning down the job is her right because she has\nreligious beliefs. and it is more beneficial for the gay to hire\nsomeone that is supportive or neutral, because no one wants to have\ntheir wedding filled with people who are forced to be there!

                " i have concerns about trump, mostly on his articulation and\nexperience, not just political experience but just being adequately\nstudied on political procedure and current events. he would need a\nreally strong cabinet, in areas he's not strong in. but as far as the\nstatement you made here, it\u2019s not actually a real or accurate\nevaluation of trump nor the situation surrounding trump. these\nstatement and other accusations are not sensible, logical arguments.\ntrump actually wants to protect people\u2019s rights. including women and\nblacks. you have to understand the personality of trump\u2026. i\u2019m a women\nand he doesn\u2019t bother me. he is a hot head. he is not politically\ncorrect. he steps in shit when he opens his mouth, not because his\nmotives are bad or evil, not because he is a dictator, and not because\nhe's a racist, or hates women. it\u2019s because he never really had to\npackage his words carefully, and he didn\u2019t intend to run for office.\ni\u2019m not saying trump is qualified in my opinion to be president. but,\ni am saying: many things you see at this time are provoked. he, trump,\nis a hot head, he is provoked. black lives matter are hotheads they\nare provoked. and they exploit and media exploits. much is taken out\nof context. many things trump has ever said in the past is just trump\nbeing trump. a celebrity, a big talker, a hot head, a real estate\ntycoon, a guy from new york. to vilifying trump is actually inaccurate\nand off base. he is not, and he should not be an excuse for a bunch of\npeople to make a platform, and lead the country by \u201cmob rules\nbehavior,\u201d and \u201cforce a power of influence and authority\u201d over\neveryone, through intimidation. i do have logically based concerns\nabout trump as president. such as \u2013 cruz brought to our attention that\ntrump is in litigation and may be sued for an expensive real estate\ncourse he ran, so being involved in that, depending on the details may\nbe a true, tangible, measurable and factual concern. the series of off\nthe cuff remarks made through his lifetime, many out of context, and\nothers in my opinion are just mouthy hot head words without a\npolitically correct filter! i didn\u2019t like his reaction to meagan kelly\nduring and after the first debate. but i don't see it as \u201chating women\nor devaluing women,\u201d i see it as he was backed into a corner, and he\nreally isn\u2019t accustomed to. and he doesn't adjust his reactions. he\nsimply is just rash, with brute honesty, wears his feelings and\nattitudes on his sleeve, and honestly just opens his mouth and steps\nin shit, and he does so in reaction at the moment, and in the heat of\nthe moment. trump is like many people i have experienced, and maybe,\neven a little like myself. so i get the crap that falls out of his\nmouth in the heat of the moment. but to vilify him by these things is\nmore of a salem witch hunt, than a true reasonable evaluation. i can\nsee why some people would say or feel things they do, or form opinions\nby what he has said or says. but there is a huge overreaction to all\nof it! and, it isn\u2019t balanced! here is trump in a nutshell: he is a\nhigh d personality with a secondary high i, he has a low level s and a\nlow level c. and that is his most likely his disc profile. (below is a\nbasic view of disc personality traits) d - dominant traits i -\ninspiring traits s \u2013 serving traits c \u2013 cautious traits so, i\u2019ll\nexplain why accusing trump of having an interest or a motive in taking\nrights away is an off base accusation. 1st of all, ask yourself why???\nwhy would he? and, why would he logically want to? 1st put yourself in\nperspective\u2026. your really not as important as you think you are to\ntrump. or, let\u2019s rephrase that to understand what i mean by that. he\nactually doesn\u2019t need to be president. i really think trump was\ndrinking a beer and said \u201dshit, i can fix this, maybe i should run for\npresident!\u201d there\u2019s a funny of trump facebook post that says that.\nbut, the real funny part of the post is, i think its closer to being\ntrue than not true!! he doesn\u2019t need to be president, he doesn\u2019t need\nyou, and he doesn\u2019t need to make you important to himself at all. he\ndoesn\u2019t need your approval in life, and he doesn\u2019t need, or want your\nrights! your life, your local economy, your future security, your\nunemployment or your ability or inability to charge a reasonable bid\nas a handyman because of competing below market bids on projects by\nunder the table alien workers - that take away your jobs and your\nincome potential and then leave you at a disadvantage, unable to take\ncare of yourself and your family! none of these things that affect\nyou, actually will ever affect trump or his family, at all. if mexican\nimmigrants get the jobs you didn\u2019t get. trump doesn\u2019t have to pay your\nmortgage, your electric, your grocery bill, and your education etc\u2026 to\ntrump, whether you have a job or not, really doesn\u2019t have any effect\non trump\u2019s life nor anyone he cares about! as far as terrorism, and\nyour safe traveling on commercial airplanes, that is the least\nimportant thing personally to trump! he has his own plane! he doesn\u2019t\nneed or want your social security check, your unemployment check, he\ndoesn\u2019t have to pay your healthcare or obamacare premiums, he doesn\u2019t\ncompete in your job market, he doesn\u2019t walk your streets and encounter\nyour neighborhood crime, nor does he encounter your area crime by\nundocumented immigrants who are or could be potential rapists\nmurderers or thieves! wait a minute, how dare he say that about\nillegal aliens, you bigot. now you wait, here is a little common sense\nthought you should also consider in forming your opinion. actually,\nillegals come in the usa without required records. we have no idea who\nor where they are, and we have no ability to do homework on them, on\ntheir background, or even their real names! because there is no id or\npassport required when you are illegal! so, through legal immigration,\nwe are more able to reject the entrance of criminals, and drug\nsmugglers. another thought, and please understand, i\u2019m making a point\nnot being cruel. but, the ones who come illegally, come from the\npoorest and most crime ridden areas of mexico. these are the people\nwho are the least likely to afford to come legally. now, compare\nbetween illegals and legals. allowing legals in the usa, we have more\nability to vet them and reject criminals, because it is required that\nthey have records, and ids and a passports. but illegals, there is a\nhigher chance of letting in criminals. 1 - because criminals can\u2019t\neasily come here legally, so they have to come illegally and 2 - most\nillegals are coming from the poorest areas that have the highest\nconcentration of crime. and illegals are traveling from these areas\nand with criminals. what they are fleeing, high crime, and poverty and\ndesperation is what they are bringing with them. without our ability\nto vet them, records, health records, criminal backgrounds, proof of\nid, passports! back to trump, he is a citizen like us, looking at\nareas the usa is messing up, and he is looking at these big problems\nand his possible solutions as a motivation and a platform, and he\nthinks he can fix it. whether he can or not, isn\u2019t relevant at the\nmoment. because we are discussing when you slice up trump, what\u2019s\ninside. his motives, his why. he didn\u2019t decide to run to prove\nhimself. he actually doesn\u2019t need to prove himself, especially not to\nyou or me. he didn\u2019t decide i feel like spending millions in running\nfor president, because that would be a prestigeous thing to do. he is\nbusiness wealthy, not politician wealthy. politicians have career goal\nleading to a presidential dream. trump probably didn\u2019t have this on\nhis career goal list, and probably not even on his jump out of a\nplane, ride the biggest roller coaster, buy an island \u2026. and\neverything else, bucket list! trumps business background: many\nsuccessful people had bankruptcies and use legal loopholes to build\nbusinesses. and atlantic city has been put out of business just about,\natlantic city is a big mess in the tristate area. because states who\ndidn\u2019t allow gambling, now do. so there are more local options for\ngambling and less people doing to atlantic city. so atlantic city\ntanked, atlantic municipality actually just shut down and closed their\ngovernment doors (for months or maybe more) because literally, they\u2019re\nbroke! so regardless, trump had great success, and is a business man.\nand, managing a big budget, of many businesses all at 1 time, and\nlowering expenses and deficiencies is something that is actually in\nhis wheelhouse! areas he sees as things that someone needs to step up\nand fix around here, in the usa. now, he is approaching issues from a\ncitizens perspective and business perspective and he is thinking, i\ncan fix this. someone has to get this stuff under a manageable\ncontrol, or it\u2019s going to face bankruptcy, maybe even bad credit,\ngovernment shut downs, refusal of future credit or ability to borrow,\nmaybe even foreclosure, or the inability to pay salaries, provide\nbenefits or funding or care or social security checks or welfare\nchecks or unemployment checks, or health care premiums in obamacare\u2026\netc. he sees policies that are hurting americans, and his approach is\nfrom a common sense citizen and a business perspective: 1- trading and\namerican businesses \u2013 trading goods with china and others, and\namerican companies who brought their business to other countries,\n(trump has bought, sold, and run companies abroad also) so as a\nbusiness person he answers the problem by strategies to strengthen\nopportunities, jobs, and make and sell more products locally, to\nstrengthen our economy, reduce inflation, and make life more\naffordable for everybody. make sense? this is a reasonable approach.\nand, this approach isn't selective of race, gender, sex orientation\netc\u2026 because it will help everyone across the board, and raise many\nblack and white people out of poverty, and there will be more money in\nour economy, in our local communities, and in households, and probably\nsignificantly will raise tax revenue from everyone, and for everyone\u2019s\nbenefit. bringing businesses home raise tax revenue from big business,\nwhich is big money, to add to our american pocketbook. 2- immigration\n- he doesn't hate mexicans, and he doesn't hate muslims. he hates \u201cthe\nproblems\u201d we have, that happen to include some people from these 2\ngroups. again, he is using a common sense citizen/businessman approach\nto problems and solutions. so 1st, lets all get in the driver seat,\nand lets all make the most logical determination for policies, in\nresponse to \u201call the problems.\u201d in our homes we can't pay the electric\nbill, and ignore the water bill. but, if push comes to shove, we may\ndo without a dinner out, or maybe, even do without cable tv for a few\nmonths. these are logical household management decisions that we all\nmay have had to make at sometime. apply the same principles to our\nproblems in the usa. in the same way, we have to divide our resources,\nand address everything and every problem in balance, according to\npriority and our future stability and safety. so when discussing the\nissue of immigration - 1st we have to define the problems and 2nd we\nhave to answer the problem. and we have to answer the problem with 1st\nmaking sure \u201cour own house\u201d has a reasonable ability to survive and\nthrive. and if we spread ourselves thin, that it\u2019s not too thin, and\nit won't add more damages to our already struggling family! - so, then\nregarding 1 problem with many sub- problems immigration: illegal\naliens, the potential for terrorism, the vetting process, the current\njob market in the usa, our own crime and then the added crime of some\nillegal aliens, our own struggles within our own communities and our\nown country - racial tensions, poverty, education, home land security,\nlaw enforcement, health insurance, medicare, our seniors,\nunemployment, underemploymwnt, international relationships, any and\nall issues, threats, and tensions, our military defense, intelligence,\nand military responsibilities and action, green card holders, and\nmore... etc... (reduce it all to small terms and apply a common sense\nexample) - we have a good little family, we are compassionate and help\nothers. but we have a limit on ability. we have limits on the good we\ncan do, and regardless of what we would like to do, the good we can do\nis limited by our ability and resources. we are limited by our own\nincome, our bills, our discretionary income, our by our own progress\nand goals as a family unit, and of each individual person within our\nown family. we also have many other obligations - our aging parents,\nother people that are directly in our path that have needs, planning\nour own years of retirement, and personal and our children\u2019s\neducation, and providing for the now and later needs and wants and\ngoals for ourselves, our children, and our grandchildren, and then\nalso more, other community involvements we are a part of like churches\nor other groups and charities that are important to us ... then\nwhatever is left over after we have met or managed the immediate\ndemands around us, what is leftover if any, is all that we have to\nwork with. we all have to understand, we just can't give everyone a\nbetter life, because 1 - it is not realistic 2 - it will hurt our\nimmediate and extended family. it would take from their basic needs,\nand also would put their future stability at risk 3 - it would prevent\nstability and goals both collectively and personally. hurting our\neconomic improvements, current growth, and future gains. well, the\ngovernment spending and budget- federal, state, and local are similar\nin comparison, but just on a way bigger and broader scale! so, when\ntrump says, \"close the boarder\" and \"build a wall,\" he isn't being\ncallus or a bigot. he is taking each of these real issues, i\nmentioned, effecting immigration and he is applying a common sense\napproach for answers according to the whole picture of immigration\ncombined with the whole picture of all the other issues in light of\nour household budget, our projected future earnings, and our already\naccrued rising national debt, along with the interest on the money we\nalready owe - (which is billions and growing by adding on top growing\nunpaid interest and also more added new debt from all the short falls\nfrom yearly spending we don\u2019t cover now by tax revenue. so this is our\nhousehold budget, and our spending and our bills are not even close to\nbeing covered. the debt grows and grows with what we don\u2019t cover in\ntaxes after our bills are paid. and that is huge!! so take issues\nsurrounding immigration, and answer it. understand the why, ask more\nquestions, see what we are willing to do without, and what we can\u2019t\nlive without. and if you cut from priority areas, like military or\nretirement social security or medicare or education. make sure you ask\nmore questions and more question and weigh every possible problem or\nconsequence. before you make your opinion, and chase idiot know it\nalls on the internet. those are likely to be the least educated among\nus. maybe even enemies of america for all you know!"

(reduce it all to small terms and apply a common sense\nexample) - we have a good little family, we are compassionate and help\nothers. but we have a limit on ability. we have limits on the good we\ncan do, and regardless of what we would like to do, the good we can do\nis limited by our ability and resources. we are limited by our own\nincome, our bills, our discretionary income, our by our own progress\nand goals as a family unit, and of each individual person within our\nown family. we also have many other obligations - our aging parents,\nother people that are directly in our path that have needs, planning\nour own years of retirement, and personal and our children\u2019s\neducation, and providing for the now and later needs and wants and\ngoals for ourselves, our children, and our grandchildren, and then\nalso more, other community involvements we are a part of like churches\nor other groups and charities that are important to us ... then\nwhatever is left over after we have met or managed the immediate\ndemands around us, what is leftover if any, is all that we have to\nwork with. we all have to understand, we just can't give everyone a\nbetter life, because 1 - it is not realistic 2 - it will hurt our\nimmediate and extended family. it would take from their basic needs,\nand also would put their future stability at risk 3 - it would prevent\nstability and goals both collectively and personally. hurting our\neconomic improvements, current growth, and future gains. well, the\ngovernment spending and budget- federal, state, and local are similar\nin comparison, but just on a way bigger and broader scale! so, when\ntrump says, \"close the boarder\" and \"build a wall,\" he isn't being\ncallus or a bigot. he is taking each of these real issues, i\nmentioned, effecting immigration and he is applying a common sense\napproach for answers according to the whole picture of immigration\ncombined with the whole picture of all the other issues in light of\nour household budget, our projected future earnings, and our already\naccrued rising national debt, along with the interest on the money we\nalready owe - (which is billions and growing by adding on top growing\nunpaid interest and also more added new debt from all the short falls\nfrom yearly spending we don\u2019t cover now by tax revenue. so this is our\nhousehold budget, and our spending and our bills are not even close to\nbeing covered. the debt grows and grows with what we don\u2019t cover in\ntaxes after our bills are paid. and that is huge!! so take issues\nsurrounding immigration, and answer it. understand the why, ask more\nquestions, see what we are willing to do without, and what we can\u2019t\nlive without. and if you cut from priority areas, like military or\nretirement social security or medicare or education. make sure you ask\nmore questions and more question and weigh every possible problem or\nconsequence. before you make your opinion, and chase idiot know it\nalls on the internet. those are likely to be the least educated among\nus. maybe even enemies of america for all you know!",
                " an answer to a debator defending legal actions against christians\nbased on \"sin is sin\" argument. religion is a protected class, and\nshould be! gays should not be a protected class, because hate against\nany group is equal hate! im a christian, and i dont think tatoos are a\nsin. others may, its their freedom to do so! born again religions, may\nnot judge where or why a person has tattoos, and likely wouldn't judge\ntheir tattos. they may have a story to tell, let them! a church i\nstepped into several years back in philly while handing out food and\nblankets with my church group refused to let me use their bathroom\nbecause i am a woman and was wearing pants. yhey may believe\ndifferently and are strict about other things that other churches are\nnot strict with. and it should be ok to believe either way, and i\ncould care less about what they believe, thats their business, my\nbeliefs are my business! tolerance, live and let live. i have a belly\nring, and one of my favorite people in the world is my baby, youngest\ndaughter, because she is sweet. she has a guage earing, and has had\npurple to teal hair since she was in jr high. wawa and starbucks won't\nhire her, because visually she has an unnatural color hair. but, there\nare plenty of jobs that will. so she chooses to keep her crazy colors,\nand work where they dont have an issue with it! many churches dont\nthink certain vices are sin, like smoking or social drinking. there\nare varying degrees of doctrines. thats why religious freedom is so\nimportant!!!! many sects if christianity are evem loose on sexual\npreference, most i know are strict. but it is not up to people, or\ngovernment, or courts to scruitinize anyone's beliefs including gays\nwho have religious beliefs that are inclusive of sexual orientaton,\nunless a real crime has been commited. just like freedom of speech of\nevery degree is protected! both speech and religious freedom are\npersonal expression regarding what they think and believe about\neverything that matters to them! disabilities are not a choice and\nbeing black isnt a choice either, although honestly, america needs to\nhead in a different direction where all people regardless of race, all\nare equaly protected, and not especially protected! protected classes\nshould be represented of all groups of people and found in every race\nand culture! such as disabilities, and religions, ages, and gender. i'\nll explain: religion because it effects all races, genders, classes,\nand found in every walk of life. every religion from christian to\nmuslim to jews etc, and also religions that are permissive, and are\ninclusive of gay membership and leadership should have religious\nfreedom. does it mean we won' t bump into each other at times, but how\nabout we behave politely and say excuse me! or ok discussed agree to\ndisagree! isnt that what a \"progressive\" society is all about!\ndisabilities protected because they need to compete according to the\nabilities they do have. and people with disabilities are present in\nevery group. and age, because they have to compete against younger\ncandidates, and again age is a factor for every group so it is\nselective of none. and women, because they need to compete equally\nagainst men who have different strengths, and women need to be able to\ncompete according to their strengths, and not limited by the\nweaknesses they may present in a workplace, physically, or even\nregards to future pregnancies, birth, maternity leaves, sick kids, and\nother family responsibilities that could cause bias or expense of down\ntime or added health insurance costs. up till recently health\ninsurances have been higher because of reproduction. an example are\nthe nuns who recently fought cost of health insurance inclusive of\nreproductive ability. and they are abstinent, (except for some who\nchange their mind and take directions leading out of the vocation) the\nfollowing groups of classes are across the board represented in every\nsingle group of race and culture. so american 1st! america is multi\ncultural so every culture should be protected classes - american 1st,\nand white 2nd, italian 2nd, black 2nd, gay 2nd, married 2nd, single\n2nd, economic class 2nd. but in every american group of people, there\nare equally specific groups whovshould be protection from\ndiscrimination. and its reasonable, because it puts competing equal\nfor all in every group. but it can't be given above religious freedom\nof all, or its selective group breeching separation of church and\nstate because then it prohibits the free exercise of religion for all,\nexcept for 1 such as lgbt. sexual orientation should not be a\nprotected class. it's a lifestyle, and sexual choice. even if you\nbelieve it was genetic, every baby is born with the same option of\nchoice, and genetic or not can choose it. but in common every group\nhas: disabled, age, gender, and religion. we as a society should have\nmoved beyond the racial division to the next phase atleast 10 years\nago. not adding more divisions!! there will always be bullies, for\neveryone, in every group. reverse discrimination is just as much a\nproblem as discrimination!! the baker could even be an example of\nthis, she was signaled out in reverse discrimination, legally, for her\nbeliefs. yet not 1 case invoving muslims was brought forth even though\nthey believe the same. there is footage showing 3 muslim bakeries who\nalso would not make a cake against their own religious beliefs!\ndiscrimination for sexual orientation opens religions up for open\nhunting season as targets to be abused by anyone who is sexually\noriented protected. re: transgender bathroom laws: we were not likely\naware or able to notice transgenders in bathrooms. but creating laws,\nprotecting them in discriminations and allowing choice of bathrooms\nare also open hunting season by anyone who wants to exploit others,\nfor personal gain, political media attention, or both, and also for\npreditors. so if transgenders are really living like their identity,\nthen go in, close the door, and dont draw unneeded attention. and live\namd let live! if arrested, there is defense! you dont need a law for\nthat! bring your doctors report and it isnt an issue! maybe an\nexclusive allowance if identified could prevent problems instead of\ncreating them. nc didnt randomly make a law, they made it in response\nto extreme demands made by groups like lgbt! so be mad at them! the\nproblem is, special interest groups want to be special, superior,\nstand out, have special privelages, and allowances. they want to be\nable to control society, and discrimination laws are a license to\ncontrol and abuse others. they are only divisive, and cause unfairness\nto others resulting in further discrimination, and reverse\ndiscrimination! and this is the liberals play ground, the more\nproblems they create, the more it looks like you all need them! there\nwill always be hate crimes for everyone. fat, ugly, body shaming, gay,\nshort, black, white, spanish, asian etc. compete as americans, put\nthese divisive groups out! and we will be the america we intended to\nbe since 1776! religious freedom was and is inclusive of all. it is\nours by constitutional guarantee! society corrected many issues,\nspecial interest groups stop progress by extremes! now its time to\nmove past it all and simply be american. making some groups a\nprotected class, leaves others unprotected ex. the baker, florist, and\nthe marriage certificate clerk. all who should have had resposible\nsociety step in and protect them, and provide alternatives of other\nbusinesses, or signers. these exclusive special interest groups are\ndivisive. examples: making an excluse black statement, and forcing us\nto see you as black is counter productive. we dont want to \"have\" to\nlike you because you are black. we want to like you because you have\nintegrity, and you care about others, and you do a great job, and we\nwant to laugh and enjoy the fun things in your culture and celebrate\nour differences, like the fun we have with italian families, or the\ndrinking irish, or the fun we poke at the amish, or the fun we have\nwith gays, (who used to actually be enjoyed by communities, who are\nnow pissed off, thanks to lgbt!) or fun women drivers or \"hey you\nguys,\" or the formality of ladies and gentlemen. groups start for\ngood, but then when they arive to a point of growth and adjustments in\nsociety for further corrections, they go backward with extremes. such\nas feminist, good movement then extreme. black movement - good then\nextreme. when the extreme defines you, and now your group becomes\nselected for rights and freedoms, while the rest of society is forced\ninto giving theirs up, then you have gone from arrived, to going\nbackwards!!! i liked gays before this crap and after i now have trust\nissues, not because they are gay, but because of their activism. the\nextreme pushed your acceptance from general acceptance, even equal\nwithout discriminatory notice, to extreme overstepping into forced\nacceptance, then division and notice. you have to decide the goal, if\nyour goal is takeover, then your a jackass, and selfish, and un-\namerican! i grew up with alot of black friends, but when i went to a\ngrocery store and a few ignorant people decided that being black gave\nthem a right to walk through me, instead of equally being girls in a\ngrocery store, i was pissed! why because i dont like black people? or\nbecause i dont like people who want to force their will on me and\nbully me because they are black. now that was 30 years ago, why is\nthis more present, instead of history? because black people make being\nblack an issue, instead of making themselves equal, they want to\nenforce selective blackness, instead of celebrating blackness. same\ndeal w gays. we will never force change on people without creating\ndivisions and discrimination. even ben carson says, he grew up poor,\nworked hard and directed his life where he wanted. no one stopped him\nbecause he was black, and no one stopped him because he was poor. and\nhe didnt paint himself white or pretend he was white, or behave like\nhe was white. he embraced being american first, and being black 2nd.\nyet his own race call him names, uncle tom, playing the white game.\nnewsflash its not the white game he played, its the american game he\nplayed. there are some bad officers, but generally if white black\nspanish gay tatoo filled biker, or whatever, respect law enforcement,\nand if you respect them and they are still harsher than they should\nbe, sue them, or take them up the chain. but its not ok to wave your\narms around cuss the officer out, and appear threatening no matter who\nyou are, and as chris rock says, you probably wont get your ass\nkicked. but thats not what these groups want, and its not the messafe\nthey are giving to the people they claim to defend! instead they push\nthem further into the eye of the storm and divide society into the\ndiscrimination and into reverse discrimination hurting all of society\nincluding the people they say they are fighting for! most people feel\nlike i do, we are angry because we are being forced, and its divisive!\nim angry at groups like lbgt! and black lives matter! yet i have gay\nyoung adults at my house everyday! im angry because we have moved\nbeyond many things and these groups do the opposite of their supposed\nintention. we didnt even notice transgenders in our bathrooms till\nlgbt decided to make us notice! my daughter has a transgender friend\n(s)he is absolutely undetectable! we honestly wouldnt stare long\nenough to notice. so if you experience anger, thank lgbt. a same w\nblm! we want people to respect each others rights and share society.\nyou have bought some lies, christianity isnt your enemy, they are not\nbullying you. but also sexuality is a big deal to just about every\nreligion. and we have a right to believe what we want. and you do\nalso, if special interest groups would stop being bullies, we all\nwould be better off. we are a mixed up diverse group of americans! we\nlove ben carson, he is not black to anyone. i hate obama, black has\nnothing to do with it! the problem with the black special interest and\ngay special interest, isnt we dont like them! its we value being\namerican plain and simple ben carson, doesnt come out and say like me\nbecause i am black. he says like me because i am ben carson! the gay\nkids that come to my house dont say like me because i am gay, they say\nlike me because i am kind and a loyal friend, and i have value because\nof who i am, and also gay. not because i am gay i force you! divisive!\nread my letter to gays on this post, it applys to blm also! gay also\nhas sex attached, sex is morality. and everyone has a right to have a\nbelief and raise their children accordingly without influence forced\nupon their family and their values. exclusive laws to gain your\npersonal goals are acceptable. laws forced on all is not. i dont\nexpect everyone to like and agree with me, neiither should anyone\nelse. should the baker have to hire you, or bake a cake. well all\nshould be a protected class! she cant assume you are sexually in\nprivate offending god or her faith. as far as hiring every single\nperson should be able to sue if there is valid discrimination.\nexamples: i am 4'11\" italian considered caucasian, if i apply to the\nbaker and she hires an applicant with less crudentials, that should be\ninvestigated. as to why, what discrimination had her choose a less\nqualified applicant? if i am black same deal, but the black person and\nme should be on equal footing on possible discrimination. if i am gay,\nsame deal. she has no right to pry into privacy, privacy is a right.\nso when gays gain exclusive law, it wiuld be better to make their\nsexuality like hippa laws, a matter of choice and permission for a gay\nto share or not share their civil union status. and if she hires a\nlower quality applicant sue! but a wedding cake is different, because\nthats disclosure of sexuality in intent to marry, and that is her\nright to believe differently about family values, sexuality, and same\nsex marriage. so turning down the job is her right because she has\nreligious beliefs. and it is more beneficial for the gay to hire\nsomeone that is supportive or neutral, because no one wants to have\ntheir wedding filled with people who are forced to be there! why would\nanyone want that? you are welcome to go to churches and even start\nchurches that are ministries that have no moral beliefs in opposition\nto the sexual morality inclusive of gay couples. an exclusive laws can\nprotect you for everything without making people feel forced and\nresent you! force will make anyone resent anyone!!!! there are better\nsolutions to your issues in society, and the lgbt agenda isnt one of\nthem. and neither is blm. be american! not black not white not gay not"

the gay\nkids that come to my house dont say like me because i am gay, they say\nlike me because i am kind and a loyal friend, and i have value because\nof who i am, and also gay. not because i am gay i force you! divisive!\nread my letter to gays on this post, it applys to blm also! gay also\nhas sex attached, sex is morality. and everyone has a right to have a\nbelief and raise their children accordingly without influence forced\nupon their family and their values. exclusive laws to gain your\npersonal goals are acceptable. laws forced on all is not. i dont\nexpect everyone to like and agree with me, neiither should anyone\nelse. should the baker have to hire you, or bake a cake. well all\nshould be a protected class! she cant assume you are sexually in\nprivate offending god or her faith. as far as hiring every single\nperson should be able to sue if there is valid discrimination.\nexamples: i am 4'11\" italian considered caucasian, if i apply to the\nbaker and she hires an applicant with less crudentials, that should be\ninvestigated. as to why, what discrimination had her choose a less\nqualified applicant? if i am black same deal, but the black person and\nme should be on equal footing on possible discrimination. if i am gay,\nsame deal. she has no right to pry into privacy, privacy is a right.\nso when gays gain exclusive law, it wiuld be better to make their\nsexuality like hippa laws, a matter of choice and permission for a gay\nto share or not share their civil union status. and if she hires a\nlower quality applicant sue! but a wedding cake is different, because\nthats disclosure of sexuality in intent to marry, and that is her\nright to believe differently about family values, sexuality, and same\nsex marriage. so turning down the job is her right because she has\nreligious beliefs. and it is more beneficial for the gay to hire\nsomeone that is supportive or neutral, because no one wants to have\ntheir wedding filled with people who are forced to be there! why would\nanyone want that? you are welcome to go to churches and even start\nchurches that are ministries that have no moral beliefs in opposition\nto the sexual morality inclusive of gay couples. an exclusive laws can\nprotect you for everything without making people feel forced and\nresent you! force will make anyone resent anyone!!!! there are better\nsolutions to your issues in society, and the lgbt agenda isnt one of\nthem. and neither is blm. be american! not black not white not gay not",
                " it was all about islam, slappy. you should educate yourself on what\nyou are talking about sometimes before showing how ignorant you can be\n(normally you're full of sunshine) like when you declare hitler was a\nchristian which is one of the most lame brained things anybody can\nsay. good thing this killer lost his cool before he became a logistics\nsupervisor like he was studying for. i think god wanted him dead\nbefore he could do bigger damage at the helm of a company controlling\nmovement of large and dangerous machines with access to practically\neverything and everywhere in the country. artan described himself as a\npious and scared muslim in an interview with the ohio state student\nnewspaper in august. \"i wanted to pray in the open, but i was scared\nwith everything going on in the media,\" he told the lantern after\ntransfering from columbus state community college. \"i'm a muslim, it's\nnot what the media portrays me to be. if people look at me, a muslim\npraying, i don't know what they're going to think, what's going to\nhappen. but, i don't blame them. it's the media that put that picture\nin their heads so they're going to just have it and it, it's going to\nmake them feel uncomfortable. i was kind of scared right now. but i\njust did it. i relied on god. i went over to the corner and just\nprayed.\" nbc news's pete williams reported on-air that artan made a\nfacebook post lamenting the treatment of muslims worldwide just before\nthe attack on monday morning. \"i am sick and tired of seeing [muslims]\nkilled &amp; tortured everywhere. ... i can\u2019t take it anymore,\" the\nposting read, according to abc news. \"america! stop interfering with\nother countries ... [if] you want us muslims to stop carrying [out]\nlone wolf attacks. quotes from the somali refugee before he went on a\nrampage trying to kill as many as he could before he was killed by\npolice. islam has always been and always will be nothing but a\nreligion of war against jews and christians. there is no such thing as\na peace loving moderate muslim, they are all guilty by association,\nall supporting the religion of murder."

                " i have concerns about trump, mostly on his articulation and\nexperience, not just political experience but just being adequately\nstudied on political procedure and current events. he would need a\nreally strong cabinet, in areas he's not strong in. but as far as the\nstatement you made here, it\u2019s not actually a real or accurate\nevaluation of trump nor the situation surrounding trump. these\nstatement and other accusations are not sensible, logical arguments.\ntrump actually wants to protect people\u2019s rights. including women and\nblacks. you have to understand the personality of trump\u2026. i\u2019m a women\nand he doesn\u2019t bother me. he is a hot head. he is not politically\ncorrect. he steps in shit when he opens his mouth, not because his\nmotives are bad or evil, not because he is a dictator, and not because\nhe's a racist, or hates women. it\u2019s because he never really had to\npackage his words carefully, and he didn\u2019t intend to run for office.\ni\u2019m not saying trump is qualified in my opinion to be president. but,\ni am saying: many things you see at this time are provoked. he, trump,\nis a hot head, he is provoked. black lives matter are hotheads they\nare provoked. and they exploit and media exploits. much is taken out\nof context. many things trump has ever said in the past is just trump\nbeing trump. a celebrity, a big talker, a hot head, a real estate\ntycoon, a guy from new york. to vilifying trump is actually inaccurate\nand off base. he is not, and he should not be an excuse for a bunch of\npeople to make a platform, and lead the country by \u201cmob rules\nbehavior,\u201d and \u201cforce a power of influence and authority\u201d over\neveryone, through intimidation. i do have logically based concerns\nabout trump as president. such as \u2013 cruz brought to our attention that\ntrump is in litigation and may be sued for an expensive real estate\ncourse he ran, so being involved in that, depending on the details may\nbe a true, tangible, measurable and factual concern. the series of off\nthe cuff remarks made through his lifetime, many out of context, and\nothers in my opinion are just mouthy hot head words without a\npolitically correct filter! i didn\u2019t like his reaction to meagan kelly\nduring and after the first debate. but i don't see it as \u201chating women\nor devaluing women,\u201d i see it as he was backed into a corner, and he\nreally isn\u2019t accustomed to. and he doesn't adjust his reactions. he\nsimply is just rash, with brute honesty, wears his feelings and\nattitudes on his sleeve, and honestly just opens his mouth and steps\nin shit, and he does so in reaction at the moment, and in the heat of\nthe moment. trump is like many people i have experienced, and maybe,\neven a little like myself. so i get the crap that falls out of his\nmouth in the heat of the moment. but to vilify him by these things is\nmore of a salem witch hunt, than a true reasonable evaluation. i can\nsee why some people would say or feel things they do, or form opinions\nby what he has said or says. but there is a huge overreaction to all\nof it! and, it isn\u2019t balanced! here is trump in a nutshell: he is a\nhigh d personality with a secondary high i, he has a low level s and a\nlow level c. and that is his most likely his disc profile. (below is a\nbasic view of disc personality traits) d - dominant traits i -\ninspiring traits s \u2013 serving traits c \u2013 cautious traits so, i\u2019ll\nexplain why accusing trump of having an interest or a motive in taking\nrights away is an off base accusation. 1st of all, ask yourself why???\nwhy would he? and, why would he logically want to? 1st put yourself in\nperspective\u2026. your really not as important as you think you are to\ntrump. or, let\u2019s rephrase that to understand what i mean by that. he\nactually doesn\u2019t need to be president. i really think trump was\ndrinking a beer and said \u201dshit, i can fix this, maybe i should run for\npresident!\u201d there\u2019s a funny of trump facebook post that says that.\nbut, the real funny part of the post is, i think its closer to being\ntrue than not true!! he doesn\u2019t need to be president, he doesn\u2019t need\nyou, and he doesn\u2019t need to make you important to himself at all. he\ndoesn\u2019t need your approval in life, and he doesn\u2019t need, or want your\nrights! your life, your local economy, your future security, your\nunemployment or your ability or inability to charge a reasonable bid\nas a handyman because of competing below market bids on projects by\nunder the table alien workers - that take away your jobs and your\nincome potential and then leave you at a disadvantage, unable to take\ncare of yourself and your family! none of these things that affect\nyou, actually will ever affect trump or his family, at all. if mexican\nimmigrants get the jobs you didn\u2019t get. trump doesn\u2019t have to pay your\nmortgage, your electric, your grocery bill, and your education etc\u2026 to\ntrump, whether you have a job or not, really doesn\u2019t have any effect\non trump\u2019s life nor anyone he cares about! as far as terrorism, and\nyour safe traveling on commercial airplanes, that is the least\nimportant thing personally to trump! he has his own plane! he doesn\u2019t\nneed or want your social security check, your unemployment check, he\ndoesn\u2019t have to pay your healthcare or obamacare premiums, he doesn\u2019t\ncompete in your job market, he doesn\u2019t walk your streets and encounter\nyour neighborhood crime, nor does he encounter your area crime by\nundocumented immigrants who are or could be potential rapists\nmurderers or thieves! wait a minute, how dare he say that about\nillegal aliens, you bigot. now you wait, here is a little common sense\nthought you should also consider in forming your opinion. actually,\nillegals come in the usa without required records. we have no idea who\nor where they are, and we have no ability to do homework on them, on\ntheir background, or even their real names! because there is no id or\npassport required when you are illegal! so, through legal immigration,\nwe are more able to reject the entrance of criminals, and drug\nsmugglers. another thought, and please understand, i\u2019m making a point\nnot being cruel. but, the ones who come illegally, come from the\npoorest and most crime ridden areas of mexico. these are the people\nwho are the least likely to afford to come legally. now, compare\nbetween illegals and legals. allowing legals in the usa, we have more\nability to vet them and reject criminals, because it is required that\nthey have records, and ids and a passports. but illegals, there is a\nhigher chance of letting in criminals. 1 - because criminals can\u2019t\neasily come here legally, so they have to come illegally and 2 - most\nillegals are coming from the poorest areas that have the highest\nconcentration of crime. and illegals are traveling from these areas\nand with criminals. what they are fleeing, high crime, and poverty and\ndesperation is what they are bringing with them. without our ability\nto vet them, records, health records, criminal backgrounds, proof of\nid, passports! back to trump, he is a citizen like us, looking at\nareas the usa is messing up, and he is looking at these big problems\nand his possible solutions as a motivation and a platform, and he\nthinks he can fix it. whether he can or not, isn\u2019t relevant at the\nmoment. because we are discussing when you slice up trump, what\u2019s\ninside. his motives, his why. he didn\u2019t decide to run to prove\nhimself. he actually doesn\u2019t need to prove himself, especially not to\nyou or me. he didn\u2019t decide i feel like spending millions in running\nfor president, because that would be a prestigeous thing to do. he is\nbusiness wealthy, not politician wealthy. politicians have career goal\nleading to a presidential dream. trump probably didn\u2019t have this on\nhis career goal list, and probably not even on his jump out of a\nplane, ride the biggest roller coaster, buy an island \u2026. and\neverything else, bucket list! trumps business background: many\nsuccessful people had bankruptcies and use legal loopholes to build\nbusinesses. and atlantic city has been put out of business just about,\natlantic city is a big mess in the tristate area. because states who\ndidn\u2019t allow gambling, now do. so there are more local options for\ngambling and less people doing to atlantic city. so atlantic city\ntanked, atlantic municipality actually just shut down and closed their\ngovernment doors (for months or maybe more) because literally, they\u2019re\nbroke! so regardless, trump had great success, and is a business man.\nand, managing a big budget, of many businesses all at 1 time, and\nlowering expenses and deficiencies is something that is actually in\nhis wheelhouse! areas he sees as things that someone needs to step up\nand fix around here, in the usa. now, he is approaching issues from a\ncitizens perspective and business perspective and he is thinking, i\ncan fix this. someone has to get this stuff under a manageable\ncontrol, or it\u2019s going to face bankruptcy, maybe even bad credit,\ngovernment shut downs, refusal of future credit or ability to borrow,\nmaybe even foreclosure, or the inability to pay salaries, provide\nbenefits or funding or care or social security checks or welfare\nchecks or unemployment checks, or health care premiums in obamacare\u2026\netc. he sees policies that are hurting americans, and his approach is\nfrom a common sense citizen and a business perspective: 1- trading and\namerican businesses \u2013 trading goods with china and others, and\namerican companies who brought their business to other countries,\n(trump has bought, sold, and run companies abroad also) so as a\nbusiness person he answers the problem by strategies to strengthen\nopportunities, jobs, and make and sell more products locally, to\nstrengthen our economy, reduce inflation, and make life more\naffordable for everybody. make sense? this is a reasonable approach.\nand, this approach isn't selective of race, gender, sex orientation\netc\u2026 because it will help everyone across the board, and raise many\nblack and white people out of poverty, and there will be more money in\nour economy, in our local communities, and in households, and probably\nsignificantly will raise tax revenue from everyone, and for everyone\u2019s\nbenefit. bringing businesses home raise tax revenue from big business,\nwhich is big money, to add to our american pocketbook. 2- immigration\n- he doesn't hate mexicans, and he doesn't hate muslims. he hates \u201cthe\nproblems\u201d we have, that happen to include some people from these 2\ngroups. again, he is using a common sense citizen/businessman approach\nto problems and solutions. so 1st, lets all get in the driver seat,\nand lets all make the most logical determination for policies, in\nresponse to \u201call the problems.\u201d in our homes we can't pay the electric\nbill, and ignore the water bill. but, if push comes to shove, we may\ndo without a dinner out, or maybe, even do without cable tv for a few\nmonths. these are logical household management decisions that we all\nmay have had to make at sometime. apply the same principles to our\nproblems in the usa. in the same way, we have to divide our resources,\nand address everything and every problem in balance, according to\npriority and our future stability and safety. so when discussing the\nissue of immigration - 1st we have to define the problems and 2nd we\nhave to answer the problem. and we have to answer the problem with 1st\nmaking sure \u201cour own house\u201d has a reasonable ability to survive and\nthrive. and if we spread ourselves thin, that it\u2019s not too thin, and\nit won't add more damages to our already struggling family! - so, then\nregarding 1 problem with many sub- problems immigration: illegal\naliens, the potential for terrorism, the vetting process, the current\njob market in the usa, our own crime and then the added crime of some\nillegal aliens, our own struggles within our own communities and our\nown country - racial tensions, poverty, education, home land security,\nlaw enforcement, health insurance, medicare, our seniors,\nunemployment, underemploymwnt, international relationships, any and\nall issues, threats, and tensions, our military defense, intelligence,\nand military responsibilities and action, green card holders, and\nmore... etc... (reduce it all to small terms and apply a common sense\nexample) - we have a good little family, we are compassionate and help\nothers. but we have a limit on ability. we have limits on the good we\ncan do, and regardless of what we would like to do, the good we can do\nis limited by our ability and resources. we are limited by our own\nincome, our bills, our discretionary income, our by our own progress\nand goals as a family unit, and of each individual person within our\nown family. we also have many other obligations - our aging parents,\nother people that are directly in our path that have needs, planning\nour own years of retirement, and personal and our children\u2019s\neducation, and providing for the now and later needs and wants and\ngoals for ourselves, our children, and our grandchildren, and then\nalso more, other community involvements we are a part of like churches\nor other groups and charities that are important to us ... then\nwhatever is left over after we have met or managed the immediate\ndemands around us, what is leftover if any, is all that we have to\nwork with. we all have to understand, we just can't give everyone a\nbetter life, because 1 - it is not realistic 2 - it will hurt our\nimmediate and extended family. it would take from their basic needs,\nand also would put their future stability at risk 3 - it would prevent\nstability and goals both collectively and personally. hurting our\neconomic improvements, current growth, and future gains. well, the\ngovernment spending and budget- federal, state, and local are similar\nin comparison, but just on a way bigger and broader scale! so, when\ntrump says, \"close the boarder\" and \"build a wall,\" he isn't being\ncallus or a bigot. he is taking each of these real issues, i\nmentioned, effecting immigration and he is applying a common sense\napproach for answers according to the whole picture of immigration\ncombined with the whole picture of all the other issues in light of\nour household budget, our projected future earnings, and our already\naccrued rising national debt, along with the interest on the money we\nalready owe - (which is billions and growing by adding on top growing\nunpaid interest and also more added new debt from all the short falls\nfrom yearly spending we don\u2019t cover now by tax revenue. so this is our\nhousehold budget, and our spending and our bills are not even close to\nbeing covered. the debt grows and grows with what we don\u2019t cover in\ntaxes after our bills are paid. and that is huge!! so take issues\nsurrounding immigration, and answer it. understand the why, ask more\nquestions, see what we are willing to do without, and what we can\u2019t\nlive without. and if you cut from priority areas, like military or\nretirement social security or medicare or education. make sure you ask\nmore questions and more question and weigh every possible problem or\nconsequence. before you make your opinion, and chase idiot know it\nalls on the internet. those are likely to be the least educated among\nus. maybe even enemies of america for all you know!",
                " friday, oct 19, 2012 11:15 am pdt gop voter registration scandal\nwidensa man originally reported to have been working for the\nrepublican party of virginia was arrested by the rockingham county,\nva., sheriff\u2019s office on thursday and charged with attempting to\ndestroy voter registration forms by tossing them into a dumpster\nbehind a shopping center in harrisonburg, va. \u201cprosecutors charged him\nwith four counts of destruction of voter registration applications,\neight counts of failing to disclose voter registration applications\nand one count of obstruction of justice,\u201d according to a report late\nthursday afternoon from tpm\u2019s ryan reilly. more charges could be\nforthcoming, according to officials. but there is more to the story,\nas evidence emerges to document that it ties into a still-expanding\nnationwide gop voter registration fraud scandal that the brad blog\nfirst began reporting in late september, after we\u2019d learned that the\nrepublican party of florida had turned in more than 100 allegedly\nfraudulent and otherwise suspect voter registration forms in palm\nbeach county. the story has continued to widen ever since, to a dozen\nflorida counties and several other states, now including virginia, and\neven to the upper-echelons of the republican party itself. the man\narrested today was 23-year-old colin small of phoenixville, pa. as it\nturns out, he does not only work for the virginia republican party.\naccording to an online profile, he appears to be working for the\nrepublican national committee and, prior to that, served as an intern\nfor rep. mike kelly, r-pa., in the u.s. house of representatives.\njoseph tanfani at the los angeles times is reporting that small was\n\u201cworking as a supervisor as part of a registration operation in eight\nswing states financed by the republican national committee.\u201d he was\nfirst hired, says tanfani, by strategic allied consulting, the firm\nowned by the disgraced gop operative and paid mitt romney political\nconsultant nathan sproul. even before this year\u2019s registration fraud\nscandal, which began with strategic in florida, sproul\u2019s companies\nhave long been accused of, though never charged with, destroying\ndemocratic voter registrations in election after election and state\nafter state, going back to at least 2004. despite that, sproul was\nhired by the bush/cheney campaign in 2004, by the mccain/palin\ncampaign in 2008, and by romney during the republican primary cycle.\nsproul\u2019s company, strategic allied consulting, was hired by the rnc in\naugust for more than $3 million, reportedly as its sole voter\nregistration company this cycle. his company was said to have been\nfired by the rnc and five different battleground state republican\nparties several weeks ago, after fraudulent voter registrations began\nto emerge across florida. some of those questionable applications\nincluded address changes for existing voters, such that florida\nelection officials told the brad blog they worry voters could find\nthemselves disenfranchised come election day. in florida, as in many\nstates, provisional ballots cast at precincts other than where voters\nare officially registered will not be counted. so changing the\naddresses on voter registrations without voters\u2019 knowledge is a\nserious crime with potentially very serious consequences. reilly\u2019s\nreport at tpm says that small \u201cworked for pinpoint, a company hired to\nregister voters on behalf of the republican party of virginia.\u201d in\nfact, pinpoint staffing placed ads to hire workers for strategic\nallied consulting in fl, va and a number of other states, though the\nbrad blog has learned that the company removed many of those ads once\nthe scandal began to break in florida. they have since modified some\nof their newer ads to hide their ties to the republican party. in\nresponse to queries we sent to sproul late thursday, his crisis\nspokesperson, david leibowitz, attempted to distance his client from\nthe arrest of the republican party worker in virginia, claiming that\n\u201cthe only connection between sproul and pinpoint is that nathan has,\non occasion, used pinpoint to hire some workers.\u201d it was pinpoint\nstaffing, in fact, which reportedly hired the man strategic blamed for\nthe fraudulent registration forms turned in originally in palm beach.\nbut while pinpoint continues to seek workers for gop-related efforts\naround the country, and as sproul\u2019s operations continue in \u201cas many as\n30 states\u201d, it is the republican national committee\u2019s response to the\nentire affair, including to the arrest today, that may be the most\ntroubling\u2026 the rnc \u2018firing\u2019 deception colin small, according to his\nlinkedin profile, as captured by the notlarrysaboto blog (which was\nthe first to highlight the initial report of a man with pa license\nplates tossing a bag of virginia voter registration forms into a\nharrisonburg dumpster), wasn\u2019t only working for the state gop or for\nstrategic allied consulting or for pinpoint. he was working as a\n\u201cgrassroots field director at the republican national committee,\u201d\naccording to linkedin. [update: nbc news is reporting this morning\nthat rnc communications director denies small was \"directly employed\nby the rnc\" and that he will be \"told to take down that.\" small is\ncurrently in jail and unable to respond to clear up the question,\nhowever.] last month, several days after fraudulent voter registration\nforms collected by strategic allied consulting and turned in by the\nflorida gop began to be discovered by county election officials in\nflorida, the rnc claimed to have fired strategic. sean spicer, the\nrnc\u2019s communications director, boasted that the party took \u201cswift and\nbold action\u201d after learning of the fraud, claiming they have \u201czero\ntolerance\u201d for it or for those who commit it. however, as we\nsummarized in our very first report on this scandal, sproul\u2019s\ncompanies have a long history of workers being paid per republican\nregistration form and for being accused of destroying democratic ones.\ndespite that, they were hired once again this year by the rnc who,\nsproul says, asked them to create the new company in june without his\nname on it to avoid it being tied to him. not very bold or zero\ntolerancy of them. though spicer said he had no knowledge of that\narrangement, sproul told the brad blog he stands by his assertion.\nbeyond that, last thursday we reported that sproul\u2019s firms, including\nwhat appeared to be a \u201cclone\u201d operation of strategic allied\nconsulting, calling itself issue advocacy partners, were still found\nworking for republicans and right-wing ballot initiatives in at least\n10 states. subsequently, on friday, the los angeles times reported\nthat, in fact, sproul was still \u201chiring workers for a voter canvassing\noperation this fall in as many as 30 states.\u201d on thursday, following\nsmall\u2019s arrest, sproul\u2019s spokesman leibowitz hedged that number by\ntelling us via email: \u201cwhat we said on the record to various media\noutlets is that his companies are working in \u2018as many as 30 states.\u2019\nthat could mean 1 state. or 2. or 30. you get the idea, i\u2019m sure.\u201d we\ndo. the idea is sproul does not want to come clean about his ongoing\noperations and who it is that he continues to work for, preferring\ninstead to live up to the \u201cshady\u201d adjective that\u2019s often applied to\nhim in the media. despite our follow-up request, leibowitz did not\nidentify the exact number of states that sproul was still working in,\nor who was paying him to do so. strategic was said to have been hired\nby state republican parties, at the request of the rnc, for voter\nregistration drives in five states (florida, north carolina, virginia,\nnevada and colorado) and for \u201cget out the vote\u201d campaigns in ohio and\nwisconsin. when both rnc and state gop officials claimed to have fired\nthem, it seems they didn\u2019t really mean it. in tanfani\u2019s report at la\ntimes late thursday, spicer confirms that, really, it may have only\nbeen sproul who the party claimed to be \u201cboldly\u201d cutting ties with.\nthe operations sproul created for the party beginning in august, the\nones that led to fraudulent voter registrations in florida and\ndestroyed applications reported in colorado and nevada as well, are\nstill in place. \u201cafter sproul was dumped,\u201d tanfani reports, \u201cthe\nregistration operation that he assembled continued working under the\nsupervision of party officials, spicer said. he said the workers will\ncontinue to do get-out-the-vote work until the election.\u201d the firing\nof sproul and strategic allied consulting was a deception. moreover,\nas the brad blog detailed on tuesday the company\u2019s mailing address,\naccording to documents released [pdf] by the florida dept. of law\nenforcement upon announcement of their statewide criminal\ninvestigation of strategic (the firm is also being criminally\ninvestigated in co), was registered as a corporation last june out of\nthe same law office run by top-level republican national committee\nelection attorneys where both karl rove\u2019s american crossroads super-\npac and the koch brothers\u2019 americans for prosperity are also based.\ndespite spicer\u2019s attempt to downplay the va incident on thursday \u2014 \u201che\nmade a mistake and he\u2019s being charged with it, which we fully support\u201d\n\u2014 as he similarly did for the fl incidents previously, it\u2019s become\nclear that the rnc\u2019s deceptive and often illegal registration and\ncanvass operations are toxic, widespread, and very high-reaching.\nironically, or perhaps not at this point, romney, who hired sproul\nlate last year as a \u201cpolitical consultant\u201d for some $71,000, appears\nto have committed both voter registration fraud and voter fraud\nhimself in massachusetts, when he voted in the january 2010 u.s.\nsenate special election between scott brown and martha coakley. while\nhe owned houses in both california and new hampshire at the time, he\ndid not own a massachusetts home until july of that year. instead, he\nused the basement of his son\u2019s belmont, mass., home as his own\nregistration address in apparent contravention of massachusetts state\nresidency laws. [see our still-growing list of other very high-profile\ngopers recently involved in apparent election fraud crimes.] trashed\nregistration forms in virginia according to fec filings obtained by\ncbs 6 in richmond last month, the virginia republican party reportedly\npaid some $500,000 to strategic for registration work before the state\ngop claimed to have fired them, several days after the fraudulent\nforms collected by strategic and submitted to county supervisors of\nelections by the florida gop began to surface in the sunshine state.\nas we now know, only sproul was fired. the voter registration\noperation itself continued. small, the man arrested on thursday and\ncharged with eight felony counts and five misdemeanors after allegedly\nhaving been found to have tossed at least eight registration forms\ninto a dumpster in harrisonburg, va. (rockingham county), was\nreportedly working for an operation named pinpoint on behalf of the\nvirginia gop, according to reilly at tpm. in an earlier report on the\nmatter at tpm, before small\u2019s arrest later in the day, reilly noted\nthat \u201cvirginia does not register voters by political party, so it\nwould be difficult for someone to discard forms from their political\nopponents.\u201d not really. reilly\u2019s assessment does not take into account\nthe very specific and purposely deceptive process used by sproul\u2019s\ncompanies \u2014 and, as suggested by evidence we\u2019ve collected, perhaps\nother republican-based voter registration outfits across the country \u2014\nto identify and register only republicans to vote, while attempting to\nfilter out democratic-leaning voters. in an investigative report\nearlier this month, the brad blog detailed video-taped and other\nevidence from nearly half a dozen states, demonstrating a deceptive,\nnational republican voter registration strategy where voter\nregistration workers purposely misrepresented themselves as pollster\nto potential registrants. essentially, as detailed in video clips and\nother testimony in that report, the gop voter registration workers\nhired by sproul were trained to pretend to be taking a poll and to ask\nvoters if they supported mitt romney or barack obama. if the answer\nwas \u201cobama\u201d, the potential registrant was thanked and sent on their\nway. if the answer came back as \u201cromney\u201d, they were given the\nopportunity to register to vote. in that way, the thousands of workers\nemployed by sproul, the former head of the arizona republican party\nand christian coalition, kept many democratic-leaning voters from\nregistering to vote at all. in one youtube video that went viral last\nmonth, a young colorado registration worker \u2014 who, it turned out, had\nbeen working for sproul\u2019s strategic allied consulting on behalf of the\nstate gop \u2014 is seen doing exactly that. another videoposted by las\nvegas abc affiliate action news 13, shows a worker there playing out\nthe same pollster scheme in nevada. sproul shared an email with the\nbrad blogin which he had boasted to other company officials that the\nvegas video tape captured their worker carrying out her training\n\u201cperfectly\u201d. in virginia, where the pennsylvania man working for the\nstate gop was arrested thursday, chesterfield county\u2019s general\nregistrar larry haake was seen explaining to richmond\u2019s cbs 6 in late\nseptember that he had received complaints of strategic employees\ndiscovered doing the same thing in a library last month. \u201cthey were\nresponsible for people that appeared in some libraries in chesterfield\ncounty, supposedly to conduct voter registration drives,\u201d haake said,\n\u201cbut they were asking voters for whom they are going to vote.\u201d haake\nsays he informed the gop of the incident at the time, but, apparently,\nno action was taken. if, in fact, small, or the workers he is said to\nhave supervised, were using the same technique of misrepresenting\nthemselves to voters about being a pollster, rather than being a\nregistration worker, it\u2019s likely he would have been able to glean\nwhether those registrations he was allegedly seen tossing into a\ndumpster were for democratic or republican-leaning voters. the\n\u2018pinpoint\u2019 piece of the puzzle in that same story on the sproul/rnc\nvoter registration deception, we cited a 9/28/12 report by the los\nangeles times that tied pinpoint staffing to sproul. the article\nquoted william t. hazard, the strategic employee said by the company\nto have turned in the original fraudulent registration applications in\npalm beach county, fla. he says he \u201cdid nothing wrong\u201d, but told the\npaper that he was trained \u201cto approach people and ask whom they\nsupported in the presidential election. when people answered with\npresident obama, he said, he wished them a good day. if someone said\nmitt romney, he asked if they were registered to vote. if not, he\nhanded them forms to fill out.\u201d he says that it was a help wanted ad\nplaced by pinpoint that led him to the work for strategic, sproul, and\nthe republican party. \u201che got the voter registration job after\nresponding to a craigslist ad placed by a company called pinpoint\nstaffing seeking people to do \u2018voter surveys\u2019,\u201d the times reported at\nthe time. \u201cthe ad specified that all applicants had to be registered\nrepublicans and active voters.\u201d further, the paper says, \u201calthough he\nreported to a pinpoint staffing office in west palm beach, he said, \u2018i\nthought i was dealing with the republican party.\u2019\u201d pinpoint was key to\nsproul\u2019s operations. so who are they? over our three-week long\ninvestigation of sproul and the gop voter registration fraud scandal,\nwe had collected dozens of help wanted ads posted by pinpoint staffing\nthat were nearly identical to others published on behalf of strategic.\nsome of those ads placed in north carolina had proved instrumental,\noriginally, to thebluenc blog\u2019s greg flynn in late august when they\nwere key to his uncovering sproul\u2019s previously-secret ownership of\nstrategic allied consulting. many of the pinpoint ads on craigslist\nand other sites \u2014 seeking \u201cvoter registration support\u201d by \u201crepublican\nparty supporter(s)\u201d, for example \u2014 were hastily removed from the\ninternet at nearly the same time that sproul and strategic were being\nouted and supposedly fired. the brad blogcaptured many of them before\nthey were taken down, some with the message: \u201cthis posting has been\nflagged for removal.\u201d we discovered ads by pinpoint staffing in dozens\nof cities, in virginia, north carolina and washington d.c., as well as\nall across florida, from pensacola in the panhandle, down to palm\nbeach county where the first fraudulent registration forms were\ndiscovered in late september. more recently, pinpoint ads for\n\u201cpolitical jobs\u201d or \u201ccampaign\u201d or \u201ccanvassing\u201d operations began to no\nlonger include references to \u201crepublican voters\u201d or \u201cromney\u201d or the\n\u201crepublican party\u201d. instead they might read \u201care you looking for your\nbig break into politics?\u201d. such ads have been found this month in\nvirginia, wisconsin, new york, arizona and florida. during our\nresearch on our report last week detailing the state\u2019s where sproul\nwas confirmed to still be working, we found evidence of his continuing\noperations under the names issue advocacy partners and grassroots\noutreach in alabama, california, georgia, louisiana, oregon,\nwisconsin, iowa, virginia, new york, new jersey and, possibly, ohio\n(where the rnc had previously admitted that strategic had been\nscheduled to do \u201cget out the vote\u201d work this year before the\n\u201cfiring\u201d.) at tpm, reilly reports that \u201ca man who answered the phone\nat pinpoint and only gave his name as ryan said he was not allowed to\ncomment. \u2018i really want to stay out of it,\u2019 he said.\u201d ads for\nstrategic placed in late summer by pinpoint in alachua, fla., and in\nseptember in winston salem, n.c., told perspective employees to\n\u201ccontact ryan.\u201d the phone number given on the ads was from phoenix,\naz. sproul\u2019s main operation is based just outside of phoenix, in\ntempe. \u201clet me be as unequivocal as possible. nathan sproul and his\nbusinesses have no ownership interest in pinpoint,\u201d his spokesperson\nleibowitz, hired by sproul to manage the crisis several weeks into it,\ninsisted to the brad blog late thursday. \u201che doesn\u2019t control it, nor\nis he affiliated with it.\u201d \u201cthe only connection between sproul and\npinpoint is that nathan has, on occasion, used pinpoint to hire some\nworkers.\u201d when we followed up to ask if sproul had used pinpoint to\nhire workers in fl, va or anywhere else, whether any of his current\ncompanies are still using them, and for what services he has used them\nin the past, or if he has since stopped, leibowitz demurred. \u201cgiven\nthat nathan\u2019s companies have no connection to the pinpoint-related\nstory you cited earlier, we see no need to go into any further\ndetail.\u201d"

                " rape in the bible rape is one of the most heinous crimes imaginable.\nyet few people know that the bible often condones and even approves of\nrape. how anyone can get their moral guidance from a book that allows\nrape escapes me. perhaps they have been lied to about the bible and\ncarefully detoured around all the nasty stuff in the bible. so grab\nyour bibles and follow along as i show you all the nasty rapes that\nyour priests and preachers don\u2019t want to tell you about. note that in\nmany places in the bible there are references to \u201ctaking a wife\u201d.\ndon\u2019t be fooled into thinking that these were voluntary marriages.\nthis first quote clearly shows that murder and force were used to\n\u201ctake\u201d these wives. 1) murder, rape, and pillage at jabesh-gilead\n(judges 21:10-24 nlt) so they sent twelve thousand warriors to jabesh-\ngilead with orders to kill everyone there, including women and\nchildren. \u201cthis is what you are to do,\u201d they said. \u201ccompletely destroy\nall the males and every woman who is not a virgin.\u201d among the\nresidents of jabesh-gilead they found four hundred young virgins who\nhad never slept with a man, and they brought them to the camp at\nshiloh in the land of canaan. the israelite assembly sent a peace\ndelegation to the little remnant of benjamin who were living at the\nrock of rimmon. then the men of benjamin returned to their homes, and\nthe four hundred women of jabesh-gilead who were spared were given to\nthem as wives. but there were not enough women for all of them. the\npeople felt sorry for benjamin because the lord had left this gap in\nthe tribes of israel. so the israelite leaders asked, \u201chow can we find\nwives for the few who remain, since all the women of the tribe of\nbenjamin are dead? there must be heirs for the survivors so that an\nentire tribe of israel will not be lost forever. but we cannot give\nthem our own daughters in marriage because we have sworn with a solemn\noath that anyone who does this will fall under god\u2019s curse.\u201d then they\nthought of the annual festival of the lord held in shiloh, between\nlebonah and bethel, along the east side of the road that goes from\nbethel to shechem. they told the men of benjamin who still needed\nwives, \u201cgo and hide in the vineyards. when the women of shiloh come\nout for their dances, rush out from the vineyards, and each of you can\ntake one of them home to be your wife! and when their fathers and\nbrothers come to us in protest, we will tell them, \u2018please be\nunderstanding. let them have your daughters, for we didn\u2019t find enough\nwives for them when we dest60royed jabesh-gilead. and you are not\nguilty of breaking the vow since you did not give your daughters in\nmarriage to them.'\u201d so the men of benjamin did as they were told. they\nkidnapped the women who took part in the celebration and carried them\noff to the land of their own inheritance. then they rebuilt their\ntowns and lived in them. so the assembly of israel departed by tribes\nand families, and they returned to their own homes. obviously these\nwomen were repeatedly raped. these sick bastards killed and raped an\nentire town and then wanted more virgins, so they hid beside the road\nto kidnap and rape some more. how can anyone see this as anything but\nevil? 2) murder, rape and pillage of the midianites (numbers 31:7-18\nnlt) they attacked midian just as the lord had commanded moses, and\nthey killed all the men. all five of the midianite kings \u2013 evi, rekem,\nzur, hur, and reba \u2013 died in the battle. they also killed balaam son\nof beor with the sword. then the israelite army captured the midianite\nwomen and children and seized their cattle and flocks and all their\nwealth as plunder. they burned all the towns and villages where the\nmidianites had lived. after they had gathered the plunder and\ncaptives, both people and animals, they brought them all to moses and\neleazar the priest, and to the whole community of israel, which was\ncamped on the plains of moab beside the jordan river, across from\njericho. moses, eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the people\nwent to meet them outside the camp. but moses was furious with all the\nmilitary commanders who had returned from the battle. \u201cwhy have you\nlet all the women live?\u201d he demanded. \u201cthese are the very ones who\nfollowed balaam\u2019s advice and caused the people of israel to rebel\nagainst the lord at mount peor. they are the ones who caused the\nplague to strike the lord\u2019s people. now kill all the boys and all the\nwomen who have slept with a man. only the young girls who are virgins\nmay live; you may keep them for yourselves. clearly moses and god\napproves of rape of virgins. 3) more murder rape and pillage\n(deuteronomy 20:10-14) as you approach a town to attack it, first\noffer its people terms for peace. if they accept your terms and open\nthe gates to you, then all the people inside will serve you in forced\nlabor. but if they refuse to make peace and prepare to fight, you must\nattack the town. when the lord your god hands it over to you, kill\nevery man in the town. but you may keep for yourselves all the women,\nchildren, livestock, and other plunder. you may enjoy the spoils of\nyour enemies that the lord your god has given you. what kind of god\napproves of murder, rape, and slavery? 4) laws of rape (deuteronomy\n22:28-29 nab) if a man is caught in the act of raping a young woman\nwho is not engaged, he must pay fifty pieces of silver to her father.\nthen he must marry the young woman because he violated her, and he\nwill never be allowed to divorce her. what kind of lunatic would make\na rape victim marry her attacker? answer: god. 5) death to the rape\nvictim (deuteronomy 22:23-24 nab) if within the city a man comes upon\na maiden who is betrothed, and has relations with her, you shall bring\nthem both out of the gate of the city and there stone them to death:\nthe girl because she did not cry out for help though she was in the\ncity, and the man because he violated his neighbors wife. it is clear\nthat god doesn\u2019t give a damn about the rape victim. he is only\nconcerned about the violation of another mans \u201cproperty\u201d. 6) david\u2019s\npunishment \u2013 polygamy, rape, baby killing, and god\u2019s \u201cforgiveness\u201d (2\nsamuel 12:11-14 nab) thus says the lord: \u2018i will bring evil upon you\nout of your own house. i will take your wives [plural] while you live\nto see it, and will give them to your neighbor. he shall lie with your\nwives in broad daylight. you have done this deed in secret, but i will\nbring it about in the presence of all israel, and with the sun looking\ndown.\u2019 then david said to nathan, \u201ci have sinned against the lord.\u201d\nnathan answered david: \u201cthe lord on his part has forgiven your sin:\nyou shall not die. but since you have utterly spurned the lord by this\ndeed, the child born to you must surely die.\u201d [the child dies seven\ndays later.] this has got to be one of the sickest quotes of the\nbible. god himself brings the completely innocent rape victims to the\nrapist. what kind of pathetic loser would do something so evil? and\nthen he kills a child! this is sick, really sick! 7) rape of female\ncaptives (deuteronomy 21:10-14 nab) \u201cwhen you go out to war against\nyour enemies and the lord, your god, delivers them into your hand, so\nthat you take captives, if you see a comely woman among the captives\nand become so enamored of her that you wish to have her as wife, you\nmay take her home to your house. but before she may live there, she\nmust shave her head and pare her nails and lay aside her captive\u2019s\ngarb. after she has mourned her father and mother for a full month,\nyou may have relations with her, and you shall be her husband and she\nshall be your wife. however, if later on you lose your liking for her,\nyou shall give her her freedom, if she wishes it; but you shall not\nsell her or enslave her, since she was married to you under\ncompulsion.\u201d once again god approves of forcible rape. 8) rape and the\nspoils of war (judges 5:30 nab) they must be dividing the spoils they\ntook: there must be a damsel or two for each man, spoils of dyed cloth\nas sisera\u2019s spoil, an ornate shawl or two for me in the spoil. (judges\n5:30 nab) 9) sex slaves (exodus 21:7-11 nlt) when a man sells his\ndaughter as a slave, she will not be freed at the end of six years as\nthe men are. if she does not please the man who bought her, he may\nallow her to be bought back again. but he is not allowed to sell her\nto foreigners, since he is the one who broke the contract with her.\nand if the slave girl\u2019s owner arranges for her to marry his son, he\nmay no longer treat her as a slave girl, but he must treat her as his\ndaughter. if he himself marries her and then takes another wife, he\nmay not reduce her food or clothing or fail to sleep with her as his\nwife. if he fails in any of these three ways, she may leave as a free\nwoman without making any payment. (exodus 21:7-11 nlt) 10) god assists\nrape and plunder (zechariah 14:1-2 nab) lo, a day shall come for the\nlord when the spoils shall be divided in your midst. and i will gather\nall the nations against jerusalem for battle: the city shall be taken,\nhouses plundered, women ravished; half of the city shall go into\nexile, but the rest of the people shall not be removed from the city.\n(zechariah 14:1-2 nab)",

taking things that people have said and saying that\nthey said something slightly the same but more provocative and\nunverifiable, you have done this to me when you claimed that i had\nsaid in a

respected journalists\nand free thinkers alive, you get another chance to challenge me on\nthis don't worry, ill be posting up in the coming days, until then you\nshould have fun on the debate i created above which goes along way to\nvindicating many of my crazy assertions. \"you accepted that at face\nvalue, no evidence, and you couldn't tell me what dictators you were\ntalking about.\" i was able to give you the names of many dictators if\ni remember correctly, its funny how what i wrote is being slowly\ndistorted when it is filtered through you, it doesnt matter though\ncause its still posted up here and anyone who wants to test this claim\ncan find the debate and they will see that i mentioned mubarak in\negyt, ben ali in tunisia, saddat (pre mubarak), the saudi regime\nbefore taking about the cia backed overthrow of mosedegh which you\nthen decided to challenge me on. you see my memory is better than you\nthink so your slimy ball tatics are not going to work, they only show\nyou for what you are, a biased apologost, now im going to be a\nhypocrite and say i am not biased but i most definitely am not the one\ntryong to defend inexcuseable actions. \"you only need proof when it's\nsomething you don't believe.\" not true, you just have this unfliching\nbeleif that anything coming from a washington spokeman is irrefutable.\n\"really? can you show me where i said this?\" well at the beginnning of\nthis debate you posted the following argument which consisted of\nexcerpt from a cnn artilce: information confirming bin laden\u2019s active\nrole in al qaeda continues to emerge, painting the portrait of a\n\u201cmicro-manager,\u201d as an unidentified u.s. official quoted in\npropublica, called him.\u201che was down in the weeds [determining] best\noperatives, best targets, best timing.\u201dand u.s. intelligence analysts\npouring over bin laden\u2019s personal diary have concluded that he was\ninvolved in \u201cevery recent major al qaeda threat.\u201d he also remained\ninvolved in planning future attacks and urged his followers to recruit\nnon-muslims and minorities - especially african americans and latinos\n- for attacks on new york city, los angeles, and smaller cities on\nsignificant dates such as july 4 and september 11. as the world\u2019s\nforemost expert on bin laden, peter bergen, summed up, \u201cobl was the\nleader of the leaderless jihad!\u201d\nhttp://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/ 2011/05/13/why-osama-bin-\nladen-mattered/ ?hpt=t2 you posted this as if to say, i told you so,\nbut after examining the article i can find precious little information\ncoming from anyone aside from us intelligence service, us officials\n(as it says in the article) or from bruce hoffman himself who is\nbasically speaking on washingtones behalf as he is a a senior fellow\nat the u.s. military academy\u2019s combating terrorism center and also\nprovides much input to washingtons propaganda machine. i beleive that\nthis article is laregly based on distorted truth and may contain one\nor two outright lies, i cannot prove this, i openly admit that. my\nquestion is do you think this is fact, cause when you presented it to\nme you gave me th eimpression that you did. you see you also said the\nfollowing to me(direct quote): \"that you accuse counter-terrorism\nofficials of lying now means you have two unfounded claims instead of\none.\" this to me says that you beleive the word of the counter\nterrorism officials as being 100% fact, it says that trying to\ninsinuate otherwise makes me a lunatic despite the fact that i posted\nexamples of us officials (both military and otherwise &amp; and the\ncurrent and former presidents) lying. here they are again just in case\nyou didnt get them the first time: http://www.youtube.com/\nwatch?v=og_m48lwkr8 http://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=btvzxsvwjtw\nhttp://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=ne2sdf1fn4s and theres fucking plenty\nmore where those came from you can be sure of it. so do you mean to\ntell me that in the face of the words that you wrote and the\ninformation you provided as being factual that you are now telling me\nthat you have changed your position and dont beleive this information\nto be accurate, or are you just saying i am an idiot for even trying\nto suggest that your precious institution consists of systematic liars\ndespite the unlimited evidence supporting it. i can find alot more\njust say the word, and ill get them for you."

                " rape in the bible rape is one of the most heinous crimes imaginable.\nyet few people know that the bible often condones and even approves of\nrape. how anyone can get their moral guidance from a book that allows\nrape escapes me. perhaps they have been lied to about the bible and\ncarefully detoured around all the nasty stuff in the bible. so grab\nyour bibles and follow along as i show you all the nasty rapes that\nyour priests and preachers don\u2019t want to tell you about. note that in\nmany places in the bible there are references to \u201ctaking a wife\u201d.\ndon\u2019t be fooled into thinking that these were voluntary marriages.\nthis first quote clearly shows that murder and force were used to\n\u201ctake\u201d these wives. 1) murder, rape, and pillage at jabesh-gilead\n(judges 21:10-24 nlt) so they sent twelve thousand warriors to jabesh-\ngilead with orders to kill everyone there, including women and\nchildren. \u201cthis is what you are to do,\u201d they said. \u201ccompletely destroy\nall the males and every woman who is not a virgin.\u201d among the\nresidents of jabesh-gilead they found four hundred young virgins who\nhad never slept with a man, and they brought them to the camp at\nshiloh in the land of canaan. the israelite assembly sent a peace\ndelegation to the little remnant of benjamin who were living at the\nrock of rimmon. then the men of benjamin returned to their homes, and\nthe four hundred women of jabesh-gilead who were spared were given to\nthem as wives. but there were not enough women for all of them. the\npeople felt sorry for benjamin because the lord had left this gap in\nthe tribes of israel. so the israelite leaders asked, \u201chow can we find\nwives for the few who remain, since all the women of the tribe of\nbenjamin are dead? there must be heirs for the survivors so that an\nentire tribe of israel will not be lost forever. but we cannot give\nthem our own daughters in marriage because we have sworn with a solemn\noath that anyone who does this will fall under god\u2019s curse.\u201d then they\nthought of the annual festival of the lord held in shiloh, between\nlebonah and bethel, along the east side of the road that goes from\nbethel to shechem. they told the men of benjamin who still needed\nwives, \u201cgo and hide in the vineyards. when the women of shiloh come\nout for their dances, rush out from the vineyards, and each of you can\ntake one of them home to be your wife! and when their fathers and\nbrothers come to us in protest, we will tell them, \u2018please be\nunderstanding. let them have your daughters, for we didn\u2019t find enough\nwives for them when we dest60royed jabesh-gilead. and you are not\nguilty of breaking the vow since you did not give your daughters in\nmarriage to them.'\u201d so the men of benjamin did as they were told. they\nkidnapped the women who took part in the celebration and carried them\noff to the land of their own inheritance. then they rebuilt their\ntowns and lived in them. so the assembly of israel departed by tribes\nand families, and they returned to their own homes. obviously these\nwomen were repeatedly raped. these sick bastards killed and raped an\nentire town and then wanted more virgins, so they hid beside the road\nto kidnap and rape some more. how can anyone see this as anything but\nevil? 2) murder, rape and pillage of the midianites (numbers 31:7-18\nnlt) they attacked midian just as the lord had commanded moses, and\nthey killed all the men. all five of the midianite kings \u2013 evi, rekem,\nzur, hur, and reba \u2013 died in the battle. they also killed balaam son\nof beor with the sword. then the israelite army captured the midianite\nwomen and children and seized their cattle and flocks and all their\nwealth as plunder. they burned all the towns and villages where the\nmidianites had lived. after they had gathered the plunder and\ncaptives, both people and animals, they brought them all to moses and\neleazar the priest, and to the whole community of israel, which was\ncamped on the plains of moab beside the jordan river, across from\njericho. moses, eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the people\nwent to meet them outside the camp. but moses was furious with all the\nmilitary commanders who had returned from the battle. \u201cwhy have you\nlet all the women live?\u201d he demanded. \u201cthese are the very ones who\nfollowed balaam\u2019s advice and caused the people of israel to rebel\nagainst the lord at mount peor. they are the ones who caused the\nplague to strike the lord\u2019s people. now kill all the boys and all the\nwomen who have slept with a man. only the young girls who are virgins\nmay live; you may keep them for yourselves. clearly moses and god\napproves of rape of virgins. 3) more murder rape and pillage\n(deuteronomy 20:10-14) as you approach a town to attack it, first\noffer its people terms for peace. if they accept your terms and open\nthe gates to you, then all the people inside will serve you in forced\nlabor. but if they refuse to make peace and prepare to fight, you must\nattack the town. when the lord your god hands it over to you, kill\nevery man in the town. but you may keep for yourselves all the women,\nchildren, livestock, and other plunder. you may enjoy the spoils of\nyour enemies that the lord your god has given you. what kind of god\napproves of murder, rape, and slavery? 4) laws of rape (deuteronomy\n22:28-29 nab) if a man is caught in the act of raping a young woman\nwho is not engaged, he must pay fifty pieces of silver to her father.\nthen he must marry the young woman because he violated her, and he\nwill never be allowed to divorce her. what kind of lunatic would make\na rape victim marry her attacker? answer: god. 5) death to the rape\nvictim (deuteronomy 22:23-24 nab) if within the city a man comes upon\na maiden who is betrothed, and has relations with her, you shall bring\nthem both out of the gate of the city and there stone them to death:\nthe girl because she did not cry out for help though she was in the\ncity, and the man because he violated his neighbors wife. it is clear\nthat god doesn\u2019t give a damn about the rape victim. he is only\nconcerned about the violation of another mans \u201cproperty\u201d. 6) david\u2019s\npunishment \u2013 polygamy, rape, baby killing, and god\u2019s \u201cforgiveness\u201d (2\nsamuel 12:11-14 nab) thus says the lord: \u2018i will bring evil upon you\nout of your own house. i will take your wives [plural] while you live\nto see it, and will give them to your neighbor. he shall lie with your\nwives in broad daylight. you have done this deed in secret, but i will\nbring it about in the presence of all israel, and with the sun looking\ndown.\u2019 then david said to nathan, \u201ci have sinned against the lord.\u201d\nnathan answered david: \u201cthe lord on his part has forgiven your sin:\nyou shall not die. but since you have utterly spurned the lord by this\ndeed, the child born to you must surely die.\u201d [the child dies seven\ndays later.] this has got to be one of the sickest quotes of the\nbible. god himself brings the completely innocent rape victims to the\nrapist. what kind of pathetic loser would do something so evil? and\nthen he kills a child! this is sick, really sick! 7) rape of female\ncaptives (deuteronomy 21:10-14 nab) \u201cwhen you go out to war against\nyour enemies and the lord, your god, delivers them into your hand, so\nthat you take captives, if you see a comely woman among the captives\nand become so enamored of her that you wish to have her as wife, you\nmay take her home to your house. but before she may live there, she\nmust shave her head and pare her nails and lay aside her captive\u2019s\ngarb. after she has mourned her father and mother for a full month,\nyou may have relations with her, and you shall be her husband and she\nshall be your wife. however, if later on you lose your liking for her,\nyou shall give her her freedom, if she wishes it; but you shall not\nsell her or enslave her, since she was married to you under\ncompulsion.\u201d once again god approves of forcible rape. 8) rape and the\nspoils of war (judges 5:30 nab) they must be dividing the spoils they\ntook: there must be a damsel or two for each man, spoils of dyed cloth\nas sisera\u2019s spoil, an ornate shawl or two for me in the spoil. (judges\n5:30 nab) 9) sex slaves (exodus 21:7-11 nlt) when a man sells his\ndaughter as a slave, she will not be freed at the end of six years as\nthe men are. if she does not please the man who bought her, he may\nallow her to be bought back again. but he is not allowed to sell her\nto foreigners, since he is the one who broke the contract with her.\nand if the slave girl\u2019s owner arranges for her to marry his son, he\nmay no longer treat her as a slave girl, but he must treat her as his\ndaughter. if he himself marries her and then takes another wife, he\nmay not reduce her food or clothing or fail to sleep with her as his\nwife. if he fails in any of these three ways, she may leave as a free\nwoman without making any payment. (exodus 21:7-11 nlt) 10) god assists\nrape and plunder (zechariah 14:1-2 nab) lo, a day shall come for the\nlord when the spoils shall be divided in your midst. and i will gather\nall the nations against jerusalem for battle: the city shall be taken,\nhouses plundered, women ravished; half of the city shall go into\nexile, but the rest of the people shall not be removed from the city.\n(zechariah 14:1-2 nab)",
                " \"you don't try to catch or execute a criminal before he has committed\na crime, sir.\" bin laden had commited many crimes and he was a wanted\nmember of al queda prior to the attacks, he is also beleived to have\nbeen behind the caraprk bombing of the trade centers in the 90s.\nyou've misunderstood my piont, if they had found out that 9/11 was\nbeing planned and captured him before it could have been executed that\nwould have been worth celebrating, they didnt, he got away with it,\nand murdering him in his bedromm (apparently) 10 years later after he\nwrought all the destruction is he intended on wreaking and helped\ndeveoped al queda into the group it is today in my opinion is not\nworth celebrating, i see no victory i see something completely\nirrelevant being painted as a victory for political gain, and to stoke\nthe ever increasingly intense fires of american nationalism. \"bohemian\nis a member of the united states military, and has been fighting\neastern insurgents in his capacity as an engineer of the same for some\ntime. i think it prudent to defer to his opinion on the nature of his\nown enemies.\" i know exactly who he is, personallly i think it is\nquite foolish to trust the opinion of anyone with his level of\nindoctrination and obvious bias. both al qaeda and mr. bin laden have\nclaimed that he was responsible for attacks on american warriors and\ncivilians. the pion is the information availible is wholly inadequate,\nany assumptions must be met with scepticism, i think most likely that\nhe was doing very little except surviving for the past 10yrs, and even\nif he wasn't (which is unlikely) his death changes nothing, there is\nno gain frmo his death, all i see is a loss. i also think he was\nkilled intentionally as his trial would most likely expose how the cia\ncreated him and his associates and i dont think the us wanted light\nshed on that for obvious reasons. \"the east has been in conflict with\nthe west for the better part of three thousand years. it is simplistic\nto state that the mutual hatred is a recent phenomenon, or entirely\nthe fault of preemptive action by the west.\" i admit you have a piont\nbut i dont have time for a proper rebuttal, im sorry come back in one\nweek ill have more time, then ill debate you properly on this issue.\n\"that's war, sir\" no its not its imperialsim, its greedy self\ninterested colonisation of resources, and the sooner you realise that\nthe sooner you may begin to see things as they are. \"well, possibly\nbecause it is so obvious to persons such as yourself that he was a\npuppet leader, doing the united states' bidding. perhaps they thought\nit expedient to demonstrate their enmity?\" this argument is incredibly\nweak, look at the history of us backed dictators and you'll find that\nthey never minded there dictators slaughtering large number of their\nown populations as long as they were getting what they required from\nthem, in the word of henry kissinger; \" america has no allies, america\nonly has interests\" besides they never demonsrated their enmity for\nsadam until he was firmly against them, and even then they left him\npower after gulf 1 in order for him to hold th country together, even\nthough that meant letting him quell (slaughter) a rebellion which was\nasked for by the us in order to aid in fighting. \"it is impossible for\na united nations sanction to be passed with the support of only two\nnations, sir.\" i never said that and you know it, i said they psuhed\nfor barbaric sanctions, they received very little support (except from\nisreal) but they used their enormous sway to get their way. why not\ntry investigating this before you try to rebuke it, i gave you more\ncredit than that. here this the perfect place to start:\nhttp://www.johnpilger.com/videos/ paying-the-price-killing-the-\nchildren-o f-iraq \"is the united states not allowed to have allies any\nmore?\" not when they give them more aid (mostly military) than all\nother countries in the world combined that they sunsequently use to\ncommit genocide against the helpless palestian people with full us\nbacking. \"i think you should apologise, sir. there is quite a\ndifference between telling somebody that they're rationalising an\natrocity, and calling them a genocidal maniac\" i admit its an extreme\nallegaion but i would not have made it if i didnt think deep in my own\nheart that that is exactly how it would play out. \"either the persons\nfired upon by the military are unarmed civilians, as you say, or armed\nhostiles, in which case it is perfectly acceptable for bohemian's\ncomrades to shoot them.\" okay lets assume they are armed hostiles, ill\nuse an anolgy to destroy this piont. take the case of ireland when\nchurchill sent in the black and tans in 1919, they slaughtered and\nraped their way around the country, they burned most of cork city and\nleft an traiil of destrcution in their wake (which is exactly what\ngood old winston wanted might i add, the savage), now they would be\nperfectly entitled to shot any armed ira man (and they did whether he\nwas amred, an ira man or a civilian i.e. man, woman and even\nchildren), but the key question is did they have a right to be there\nin the first place??????????????? \"i have conquered the aedui in\nbattle therefore it is my right to impose whatever conditions on them\nas i please.\" julius caesar, imperator of the gallic legions\" so you\nadvocating a return to the savage times when might was right, is that\nit?????"

and it's utopia, but you never answered\nwhether you ever read the book. well, i read the book 1984, a dystopic\nworld. and it is so close to that, now, it is unbelievable. this is\nenslavement, on so many indirect levels. the rest of us would form\ngovernments to guide might, constrain force and violence, stipulate\nconsistent consequences for wrongs, and seek the fairest process by\nwhich guilt is determined. then, i and others like me, would be there,\nfighting you, every step of the way because you have no right to\ncontrol anyone and \"stipulate\" consequences for wrongs. there are\nbetter ways to achieve freedom, but that is not it. due process is not\na natural right. it's a legislated right in place to protect the\ninnocent and it arises due to the high degree of fallibility of\nvigilantism. right, and i guess innocent men or women have not been\nput to death by the \"government\", ever. as if they even recognize due\nprocess. the court is by their rules. the jury is typically ignorant\nof what \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" means. they are thoroughly checked\nby the lawyer to be sure that they get such a pool. and the judge\ngives the jury \"instructions\" about finding according to \"the law\" not\nwhether there was any wrong done in spite of the \"law\", as in was\nthere someone harmed. it does not exist without laws because it is the\nlaw for how to determine punishable guilt. given the fact that due\nprocess is literally and necessarily a host of laws, it cannot exist\nwithout government. then, i guess it does not exist because\n\"government\" as in, \"political authority\" does not exist. and they\ncannot give us our rights, those are inalienable. there is no\n\"somehow\" to have due process in anarchy. when you go marching off to\nkill the killer, only to find too late that the supposed killer was\ndefending himself, isn't the right person, did it completely by\naccident, or any of a number of mitigating factors, you can tell the\nlynch mob coming for you that you know you are right because you know\nthe truth, but they will not be convinced. especially not when they're\nactually right and what you insist is truth turns out to be misguided\nopinion that lead you to murder someone. i said i would go after the\nkiller of my family, with the means i have available. i did not say i\nwould out right kill them. but i would not let them get away with it.\nthat is my point. i would find out why. i would investigate for myself\nto find justice for my family. what i have spoken here is not\nmisguided opinion. i have been researching this and studying it, for\nseveral years now. not to mention my own experiences. just as due\nprocess in criminal law is created to protect the innocent from\nincorrect retribution, the process of civil law is created to fairly\ndetermine appropriate restitution. these are human institutions so of\ncourse they can get it wrong. however, they reduce the amount of human\nerror in retribution and restitution. your so called anarchy maximizes\nit. that is very much doubtful. and it is not my anarchy. it is what\nis. it is what we have now. \"authority\" attracts the very types that\nyou say would take over. newsflash, they already have. the many\ntyrants, known as congress, are cockroaches. the political circus only\nemboldens them, and they play god when they write \"laws\". true\nconflicts of restitution and of retribution both necessitate an\nirresistible independent arbiter for resolution. i did not dispute\nthat. in fact, i said people could hire an arbiter to do just that.\nbut they don't pretend to have \"authority\". the alternative is a world\nof tyrants where it doesn't matter whether might makes right so long\nas might is effective. we already have such a world. your position is\none of rousseauian idealism and subjectivism. hardly. your position is\nsupportive of a gigantic criminal gang called \"government\". it is\ndystopic. it is slavery. it shares much with other utopian ideologies.\nyou will convince very few so long as you insist on having the truth\nwhile neglecting to provide any basis beyond that assertion. i have\nprovided sources to show what i am talking about. i posted a video of\na presentation that was done on natural law. did you watch it? in this\nresponse, i provided a link to a book that breaks down the massive\nmind control that has been implemented. will you read it? here is\nanother book link:https://www.amazon.com/ most-dangerous-\nsuperstition/dp/ b0886dw69h/ref=sr

through any of the\nmaterial i just posted here. because you aren't interested in truth.\nyou certainly, did not provide much for your argument. as far as i\nknow, you know nothing about utopia, but continue to use that to try\nto divert from what i have been saying here. if you choose to respond\nto this and the response is as repetitive as this discussion has\nbecome, you can skip it. it would be sufficient to just assume i\ndisagree. that's what i will do rather than responding. it only sounds\nrepetitive because i stood my ground and did not waver. anyone reading\nit will see that this is

                " rape in the bible rape is one of the most heinous crimes imaginable.\nyet few people know that the bible often condones and even approves of\nrape. how anyone can get their moral guidance from a book that allows\nrape escapes me. perhaps they have been lied to about the bible and\ncarefully detoured around all the nasty stuff in the bible. so grab\nyour bibles and follow along as i show you all the nasty rapes that\nyour priests and preachers don\u2019t want to tell you about. note that in\nmany places in the bible there are references to \u201ctaking a wife\u201d.\ndon\u2019t be fooled into thinking that these were voluntary marriages.\nthis first quote clearly shows that murder and force were used to\n\u201ctake\u201d these wives. 1) murder, rape, and pillage at jabesh-gilead\n(judges 21:10-24 nlt) so they sent twelve thousand warriors to jabesh-\ngilead with orders to kill everyone there, including women and\nchildren. \u201cthis is what you are to do,\u201d they said. \u201ccompletely destroy\nall the males and every woman who is not a virgin.\u201d among the\nresidents of jabesh-gilead they found four hundred young virgins who\nhad never slept with a man, and they brought them to the camp at\nshiloh in the land of canaan. the israelite assembly sent a peace\ndelegation to the little remnant of benjamin who were living at the\nrock of rimmon. then the men of benjamin returned to their homes, and\nthe four hundred women of jabesh-gilead who were spared were given to\nthem as wives. but there were not enough women for all of them. the\npeople felt sorry for benjamin because the lord had left this gap in\nthe tribes of israel. so the israelite leaders asked, \u201chow can we find\nwives for the few who remain, since all the women of the tribe of\nbenjamin are dead? there must be heirs for the survivors so that an\nentire tribe of israel will not be lost forever. but we cannot give\nthem our own daughters in marriage because we have sworn with a solemn\noath that anyone who does this will fall under god\u2019s curse.\u201d then they\nthought of the annual festival of the lord held in shiloh, between\nlebonah and bethel, along the east side of the road that goes from\nbethel to shechem. they told the men of benjamin who still needed\nwives, \u201cgo and hide in the vineyards. when the women of shiloh come\nout for their dances, rush out from the vineyards, and each of you can\ntake one of them home to be your wife! and when their fathers and\nbrothers come to us in protest, we will tell them, \u2018please be\nunderstanding. let them have your daughters, for we didn\u2019t find enough\nwives for them when we dest60royed jabesh-gilead. and you are not\nguilty of breaking the vow since you did not give your daughters in\nmarriage to them.'\u201d so the men of benjamin did as they were told. they\nkidnapped the women who took part in the celebration and carried them\noff to the land of their own inheritance. then they rebuilt their\ntowns and lived in them. so the assembly of israel departed by tribes\nand families, and they returned to their own homes. obviously these\nwomen were repeatedly raped. these sick bastards killed and raped an\nentire town and then wanted more virgins, so they hid beside the road\nto kidnap and rape some more. how can anyone see this as anything but\nevil? 2) murder, rape and pillage of the midianites (numbers 31:7-18\nnlt) they attacked midian just as the lord had commanded moses, and\nthey killed all the men. all five of the midianite kings \u2013 evi, rekem,\nzur, hur, and reba \u2013 died in the battle. they also killed balaam son\nof beor with the sword. then the israelite army captured the midianite\nwomen and children and seized their cattle and flocks and all their\nwealth as plunder. they burned all the towns and villages where the\nmidianites had lived. after they had gathered the plunder and\ncaptives, both people and animals, they brought them all to moses and\neleazar the priest, and to the whole community of israel, which was\ncamped on the plains of moab beside the jordan river, across from\njericho. moses, eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the people\nwent to meet them outside the camp. but moses was furious with all the\nmilitary commanders who had returned from the battle. \u201cwhy have you\nlet all the women live?\u201d he demanded. \u201cthese are the very ones who\nfollowed balaam\u2019s advice and caused the people of israel to rebel\nagainst the lord at mount peor. they are the ones who caused the\nplague to strike the lord\u2019s people. now kill all the boys and all the\nwomen who have slept with a man. only the young girls who are virgins\nmay live; you may keep them for yourselves. clearly moses and god\napproves of rape of virgins. 3) more murder rape and pillage\n(deuteronomy 20:10-14) as you approach a town to attack it, first\noffer its people terms for peace. if they accept your terms and open\nthe gates to you, then all the people inside will serve you in forced\nlabor. but if they refuse to make peace and prepare to fight, you must\nattack the town. when the lord your god hands it over to you, kill\nevery man in the town. but you may keep for yourselves all the women,\nchildren, livestock, and other plunder. you may enjoy the spoils of\nyour enemies that the lord your god has given you. what kind of god\napproves of murder, rape, and slavery? 4) laws of rape (deuteronomy\n22:28-29 nab) if a man is caught in the act of raping a young woman\nwho is not engaged, he must pay fifty pieces of silver to her father.\nthen he must marry the young woman because he violated her, and he\nwill never be allowed to divorce her. what kind of lunatic would make\na rape victim marry her attacker? answer: god. 5) death to the rape\nvictim (deuteronomy 22:23-24 nab) if within the city a man comes upon\na maiden who is betrothed, and has relations with her, you shall bring\nthem both out of the gate of the city and there stone them to death:\nthe girl because she did not cry out for help though she was in the\ncity, and the man because he violated his neighbors wife. it is clear\nthat god doesn\u2019t give a damn about the rape victim. he is only\nconcerned about the violation of another mans \u201cproperty\u201d. 6) david\u2019s\npunishment \u2013 polygamy, rape, baby killing, and god\u2019s \u201cforgiveness\u201d (2\nsamuel 12:11-14 nab) thus says the lord: \u2018i will bring evil upon you\nout of your own house. i will take your wives [plural] while you live\nto see it, and will give them to your neighbor. he shall lie with your\nwives in broad daylight. you have done this deed in secret, but i will\nbring it about in the presence of all israel, and with the sun looking\ndown.\u2019 then david said to nathan, \u201ci have sinned against the lord.\u201d\nnathan answered david: \u201cthe lord on his part has forgiven your sin:\nyou shall not die. but since you have utterly spurned the lord by this\ndeed, the child born to you must surely die.\u201d [the child dies seven\ndays later.] this has got to be one of the sickest quotes of the\nbible. god himself brings the completely innocent rape victims to the\nrapist. what kind of pathetic loser would do something so evil? and\nthen he kills a child! this is sick, really sick! 7) rape of female\ncaptives (deuteronomy 21:10-14 nab) \u201cwhen you go out to war against\nyour enemies and the lord, your god, delivers them into your hand, so\nthat you take captives, if you see a comely woman among the captives\nand become so enamored of her that you wish to have her as wife, you\nmay take her home to your house. but before she may live there, she\nmust shave her head and pare her nails and lay aside her captive\u2019s\ngarb. after she has mourned her father and mother for a full month,\nyou may have relations with her, and you shall be her husband and she\nshall be your wife. however, if later on you lose your liking for her,\nyou shall give her her freedom, if she wishes it; but you shall not\nsell her or enslave her, since she was married to you under\ncompulsion.\u201d once again god approves of forcible rape. 8) rape and the\nspoils of war (judges 5:30 nab) they must be dividing the spoils they\ntook: there must be a damsel or two for each man, spoils of dyed cloth\nas sisera\u2019s spoil, an ornate shawl or two for me in the spoil. (judges\n5:30 nab) 9) sex slaves (exodus 21:7-11 nlt) when a man sells his\ndaughter as a slave, she will not be freed at the end of six years as\nthe men are. if she does not please the man who bought her, he may\nallow her to be bought back again. but he is not allowed to sell her\nto foreigners, since he is the one who broke the contract with her.\nand if the slave girl\u2019s owner arranges for her to marry his son, he\nmay no longer treat her as a slave girl, but he must treat her as his\ndaughter. if he himself marries her and then takes another wife, he\nmay not reduce her food or clothing or fail to sleep with her as his\nwife. if he fails in any of these three ways, she may leave as a free\nwoman without making any payment. (exodus 21:7-11 nlt) 10) god assists\nrape and plunder (zechariah 14:1-2 nab) lo, a day shall come for the\nlord when the spoils shall be divided in your midst. and i will gather\nall the nations against jerusalem for battle: the city shall be taken,\nhouses plundered, women ravished; half of the city shall go into\nexile, but the rest of the people shall not be removed from the city.\n(zechariah 14:1-2 nab)"

level of certainty you claim.\"\ni acccept that, my problem is that what you claim proves my piont is\nless certain than yours i beleive only reinforces my piont i.e. you\nuse washington propaganda to bolster your opinion, i find that\nincredibly weak give that it literally has zero credibility. \"i think\nbecause i'm in the army, i know how the army works. and i do\" i never\ndisputed that, i openly admit that your knowledge and experience in\nthe us army trumps anything i say about how the us army operates \"i\nthink because i've been to afghanistan, i have a much greater\nunderstanding of the situation than you do.\" you see this i have to\ndisagree with, ive been to iran but if you decide to debate me on iran\ni will not claim that i have because ive been their any argument you\nuse is flawed just because ive been their and have that experience.\nthe reason i find this argument weak can be explained as follows, you\nprobably went to afghanistan beleiveing what you currently beleive, it\nis my assertion that going there with the us army would only further\nreinforce those beliefs as i imagine there is an us against them\nfeeling perpetuated in the us army although i cannot prove this. if\nyou would allow me to use vietnam as an example, a soldier goes to\nvietnam beleiving that they are helping to preserve democracy arounf\nthe world and fight the red plague, he goes there, he fights and\nkills, and some of friends get killed, i dont think hes going to have\na different opinion on why he went, it will only be reinforced, unless\nhe took part in some of the unbeleivable massacres that went on there\nand maybe his compassion forced him to change his views. \"this is\nsomeone who reads about war telling someone who has actually been\nthrough it,\" im not taking about war, you are, i am taking about\nmotives in warfare, if you want to talk about how war is conducted,\nhow operation take place within countries in order to suppress the\nenemy then i openly admit your superiority but unfortunately for your\nmassive ego this debate doesnt entitle you to play that card. \"this is\nsensationalism. any sensible person can see through it.\" if you say\nso, personally i find it pretty rational but im open to being\nchallenged on that. \"i could just as easily accuse you of clinging to\nyour \"lies\", with an equal amount of success.\" go ahead then i think\nyou'll find if you do that im not as fanatial as you think. \"this is\nnot an argument. you can accuse your opponent of \"clinging to lies\"\nuntil you're red in the face, but that isn't going to make your\nposition correct.\" you're entirely correct, i just really wanted you\nto hear it, if you hear it enough then maybe when you actually do it\nyou start to realise it. \"your arguments are nothing more than a\nseries of unsupported accusations consisting of loaded, highly\nconnotative terms.\" i fail to see how reached that conclusion based on\nthe available evidence, i mean i completely understand how you wanted\nto reach that conclusion i just fail to see how you did so based on\nfact. \"your arguments discredit themselves.\" which ones, i (unlike\nyou) have openly admitted when and when i was not speculating, in fact\nthat piont i made about osama being assasinated in order to keep him\nfrom revealing his dealings with the cia may have been reading into\nthe event a bit to much, a simplistic approach may be more close to\nthe truth e.g. bin laden was assasinated soley for the political gain\nassociated with killing the great satan, as in obama has really\ndelivered on any of his yes we can bullshit but hey he got osama man,\nhes our commander and chief and he got osama. this may be closer to\nthe reality. if you still doubt whether osama was assasinated or not i\nrefer you to the following debate (your name is mentioned in it so id\nsay you want to through in your two cents): http://www.createdebate.co\nm/debate/show/looks_like_one_of_my_crazy_spurious_speculations_about_o\nsama_bin_laden_was_correct \"you made the claim that al qaeda \"probably\nwasn't even behind 9/11\" without flinching, but when an intelligence\ndirector has documents linking osama bin laden to recent al qaeda\nactivity, you suddenly need proof\" i made no such claim you slime\nball, you love taking things that people have said and saying that\nthey said something slightly the same but more provocative and\nunverifiable, you have done this to me when you claimed that i had\nsaid in a previous denbate that none of saddams former gurads and\nsoldiers would be involved in the iraqi insurgency, hers is a direct\nquote from that post: \"you said previously that the iraqi insurgency\nwasn't composed of former saddam supporters\" please show me when and\nwhere i made such a ridiculous claim.this is a very slimy way of\ntrying to win a debate, i cannot beleive you would stoop so slow as to\ntry to put those words in my mouth. i know exactly what i said and it\nalso happens to be a view endorsed by many people who are far more in\nthe know than you or i. i said that osama bin laden role in the 9/11\nattacks may not have been as significant as made out to be i.e. he may\nnot have been the mastermind, he may just have funded it. but you\nobviously want to try to tar me anyway you can so go ahead cause im\nready for you. now if you think that i said something different please\nshow me. otherwise save you slimy slippery claims that only show you\nto be as untrustworthy as the institution you represent i.e. the us\narmy \"your double standard is absolutely astounding! where was your\ndesire for proof when you claimed that 9/11 was the result of propping\nup dictators in the middle-east?\" oh dont worry i plan to create a\nwhole debate about this topic, its going to have multiple links to\narticles and documentaries from some of the most respected journalists\nand free thinkers alive, you get another chance to challenge me on\nthis don't worry, ill be posting up in the coming days, until then you\nshould have fun on the debate i created above which goes along way to\nvindicating many of my crazy assertions. \"you accepted that at face\nvalue, no evidence, and you couldn't tell me what dictators you were\ntalking about.\" i was able to give you the names of many dictators if\ni remember correctly, its funny how what i wrote is being slowly\ndistorted when it is filtered through you, it doesnt matter though\ncause its still posted up here and anyone who wants to test this claim\ncan find the debate and they will see that i mentioned mubarak in\negyt, ben ali in tunisia, saddat (pre mubarak), the saudi regime\nbefore taking about the cia backed overthrow of mosedegh which you\nthen decided to challenge me on. you see my memory is better than you\nthink so your slimy ball tatics are not going to work, they only show\nyou for what you are, a biased apologost, now im going to be a\nhypocrite and say i am not biased but i most definitely am not the one\ntryong to defend inexcuseable actions. \"you only need proof when it's\nsomething you don't believe.\" not true, you just have this unfliching\nbeleif that anything coming from a washington spokeman is irrefutable.\n\"really? can you show me where i said this?\" well at the beginnning of\nthis debate you posted the following argument which consisted of\nexcerpt from a cnn artilce: information confirming bin laden\u2019s active\nrole in al qaeda continues to emerge, painting the portrait of a\n\u201cmicro-manager,\u201d as an unidentified u.s. official quoted in\npropublica, called him.\u201che was down in the weeds [determining] best\noperatives, best targets, best timing.\u201dand u.s. intelligence analysts\npouring over bin laden\u2019s personal diary have concluded that he was\ninvolved in \u201cevery recent major al qaeda threat.\u201d he also remained\ninvolved in planning future attacks and urged his followers to recruit\nnon-muslims and minorities - especially african americans and latinos\n- for attacks on new york city, los angeles, and smaller cities on\nsignificant dates such as july 4 and september 11. as the world\u2019s\nforemost expert on bin laden, peter bergen, summed up, \u201cobl was the\nleader of the leaderless jihad!\u201d\nhttp://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/ 2011/05/13/why-osama-bin-\nladen-mattered/ ?hpt=t2 you posted this as if to say, i told you so,\nbut after examining the article i can find precious little information\ncoming from anyone aside from us intelligence service, us officials\n(as it says in the article) or from bruce hoffman himself who is\nbasically speaking on washingtones behalf as he is a a senior fellow\nat the u.s. military academy\u2019s combating terrorism center and also\nprovides much input to washingtons propaganda machine. i beleive that\nthis article is laregly based on distorted truth and may contain one\nor two outright lies, i cannot prove this, i openly admit that. my\nquestion is do you think this is fact, cause when you presented it to\nme you gave me th eimpression that you did. you see you also said the\nfollowing to me(direct quote): \"that you accuse counter-terrorism\nofficials of lying now means you have two unfounded claims instead of\none.\" this to me says that you beleive the word of the counter\nterrorism officials as being 100% fact, it says that trying to\ninsinuate otherwise makes me a lunatic despite the

(leviticus 20:9\nnlt) death for adultery if a man commits adultery with another man\u2019s\nwife, both the man and the woman must be put to death.

militaries and intelligence\nnetworks.\" i dont think so, i think his death will only antagonise his\nfollowers who are many (given the last tens years destruction produced\nby the us in the arab world). \"that is fallacious thinking\" no its\nnot. \"the entire group is wanted by most western governments\" yes but\ni think we can both agree bin laden was wanted a little bit more than\nany other group member, just a little bit. \"such a line of reasoning\nposits that it would be impossible for them to conduct any operation\nat all.\" no it doesnt, in fact i find that quite a pathetic attempt to\ndiscredit my argument, inferring that just cause the the supposed\nleader of the group and the most wanted is limited in his capacity to\nlead does not mean the group would be in any way hindered in\nconducting operations, the fact is they probably learned (or were\nforced to learn) to operate without his input along time ago. \"a man's\ndeath is not irrelevant simply because he can be replaced\" yes it is,\nhe was made into a hitler by western (maninly us ) media, so his death\nis celebrated as such but soon they will find a new hitler, if they\nhavent already, how else can they justify their illegal imperialistic\nactions, there must be someone who can threaten us security otherwise\nthey'd have to admit there just being imperialists. \"else\nassassination would be a futile practice\" if you say so my friend. \"we\nhave demonstrated the mortality of their spiritual leaders.\" quite\nstupid if i may say so.may i? \"i find it quite patronising\" i glad i\nfind everything you type to incredibly patronising, probably because\nyou think your powerful intellect provides you with insight you\nclearly dont have. \"you are in no position to make absolute claims\nabout a man with whom you are not in the least way involved or\nconnected.\" and you (or bohemian) do? \"your rejection of the united\nstates government's position is simplistic and too passionate to be a\nreasonable examination\" if you say so, i find beleiving any that comes\nfrom washington as fact is quite stupid given that time and time again\nthey have demonstrated their capacity to blantantly lie in order to\nfurther their own self interested agenda. \"notwithstanding, you have\ncalled it both a lie and a fallacy. it cannot be both\" i'm well bloody\naware it cannot be both and this just proves you havent been readin my\nresponses as if you had you'd know i think it is either/or. \"he has\nquestioned their economic policies many times\" yes and im sure he has\ncriticised the liberals, god knows who else. you don't understand my\nposition at all. \"but you continue to fail to even recognise the\nirrelevance of virtually every claim you have made against that\ngovernment\" i dont think any of the claims i have made are irrelevant,\nand whats more you can't prove there relevance or irrelevance. \"for\none, the motivation for the iraq war of which you are so fond of\ndecrying has virtually no connection to the american's portrayal of\nosama bin laden\" i wouldnt say that the fact that washingtone falsely\nclaimed that saddam hussein was in collaboration with al queda top\nofficials prior to the invasion (or have you forgotten those old lies)\nqualifies as \"virtually no connection to the american's portrayal of\nosama bin laden\", in fact i think it qualifies, and whats more i do\nbeleiv i just caught you by your ballsack my friend whether your big\nenough to admit it or not. \"yet you continue to assert that their\nvilification of the man was a means by which to pacify a public which\nopposed the conflict\" thats because it was, my god man, you need to do\nsome serious research on this topic, i dont even know why im\nentertaining you. \"your previous words are not coherent with those\nabove\" yes they are and any impartial observer will agree. \"t\nvirtually every turn, you have stated that our refusal to accept your\nsimplistic version of events is a sign of our \"small-minded[ness]\",\n\"indoctrination\" or \"ignorance\" again you try to paint me with this\nbrush, i have stated i may be wrong, i have stated you may be right, i\nhave also stated that there is inadequate info. to prove or disprove\neither of us (or bohemian), no it you who continues to tell me that i\nam a fool for beleiving what i do as washington has already cleared up\nthe matter, your only demonstrating your ignorance (in my opinion).\n\"your own position, sir, is far from moderate\" im well aware of that.\n\"you have desperately few facts\" oh yes i forgot about the littany of\nfacts you have at your diposal. \"facts, your accusations have no\nrelevance and when pressed for even the slightest mote of substance\nyou resort to argumenta ad hominem\" to you that have no relelvance,\nand i think you'll find you have resorted to argumenta ad hominem just\nas much as i have. \"meanwhile, you pretend to acknowledge the\nfallibility of your position yet stubbornly refuse to accept that it\nis anything but the whole and complete truth. \" no, i have accepted\nthat my position may be incorrect but im not going to change it until\nevidence proving it to be incorrect comes to light, and whats more i\nbeleive that is whjat any rational person would do. \"the fact is he\nprobably had wasnt even the master mind of 9/11\" so you think he was\nthe sole mastermind of 9/11 and you believe asserting the opposite to\nbe completely unfounded. \"really this guy is no figure head\" ill give\nyou this one, bad choice of words. \"bin laden could have easily been\ncaptured and put on trial... but no he was killed probably for that\nexact reason i.e. obama didn't want the info\" this is far from\nunfounded, adn you should know it, but selecting only proves you dont.\namerica created bin laden and his cohorts, they had murky dealings\nwith him aloong time before the relationship soured, i dont beleive\nsaying that they killed him to keep those dealings from becoming known\nto the world (via trial) is unfounded, i admit it may be wrong but it\nis certainly not unfounded. \"this man... has been living in a\npakistani mansion for the last 10 yrs... ill bet with us knowledge as\nwell\" ill give you this one aswell. anymore, by my count thats two you\nfound. \"i suspect you have simply read the articles of mr. fisk, and\nbelieved almost everything in them as absolute fact. \" ya thats\nexactly what i didm thanks for letting me know, now i can finally\nchange my opinion about this, what would i do without you. \"the fact\nthat you have used this debate as a platform to discredit the united\nstates government demonstrates your desperation to libel them\" if you\nsay so. \"there is no substance to this response\" if you say so. \"in\nconjunction, no doubt with your spelling\" agauin yes, thanks for\nnoticing. \"your responses exhibit such paucity of substance that one\nwonders whether they would be an adequate subsistence for the\nslightest of intellectual mice\" again man seriously you need to work\non your insults. \"oh mr. tonkin galvin you are too cruel\" i have to\nadmit i laughed out loud at this one. \"what do i think? i think you\nhave allowed your indignation as an irishman to influence your opinion\nof me more than the opinions i have expressed\" i think you may be\npartially correct in saying this, also i did retract it in a different\ndebate. \"i also believe that you are intimidated by my superior\nfaculties of articulation\" i have to take issue with this, i learned a\nlong time ago to value what i have, and not be intimidated or envious\nof anyone who is superior to me in any of the various faculties. \"and,\nas a means of coping, masquerade your fear as contempt.\" now you've\nreally gone into a world of your own, but if thats what you'd like to\nbeleive i wont take issue with it.i can tell you probably cling to\nmany fantasies. \"i think you dislike the combination of my facility of\nspeech with my english manner\" already adressed this. \"because it\nconjures images of the persecution of your ancestors and that you\nlevel your contumely at me out of petty nationalism\" again you delve\ninto a worl of your own, to reduce my opinion you to petty nationalism\nshows your capacity to valid prediction about people.but again if you\nwant to beleive this go right ahead. \"which, it is my solemn duty to\nobserve, is the characteristic feature of so many of your people\" i\nwas waiting for it, and then you deleivered, you need to learn the\nmeaning of the word humility. \"the

                " i think it was the best policy at that time in britain despite the\nmany failures after the appeasement because the fact that even if they\nwere to deploy their army at that point in time in retaliation, there\nwas a slim chance that they could have won against germany who had air\nforces which were very devastating as shown during the spanish civil\nwar. and if they were to lose, they would suffer more losses such as\nmanpower than which if they did the appeasement and took the time to\nprepare. i do agree that the appeasement that they had executed could\nhave been better, however, it was the best decision at that time. this\ncan also can be shown where hitler was also useful to them in removing\ncommunism.",
                " i dont think so, i think his death will only antagonise his followers\nwho are many they are already our enemies. they are not rational,\ntheir opposition to us is a matter of dogma. i don't believe it is\npossible to intensify their hatred. we must wear them down by showing\nthat they may take no refuge under the wings of their leaders. we must\nhunt those leaders down one by one and kill them all, as we did with\nosama bin laden, or, if possible trial and execute them. no it doesnt,\nin fact i find that quite a pathetic attempt to discredit my argument\ninferring that just cause the the supposed leader of the group and the\nmost wanted is limited in his capacity to lead does not mean the group\nwould be in any way hindered in conducting operations your position is\nutterly and completely untenable. your suggestion is that a wanted man\ncould not lead a group of wanted men because he is wanted, when it is\nquite clear that, with or without him, this group of wanted men is\nable to operate. exactly how do you think that managing the group\nwould in any way jeopardise osama bin laden's safety? yes it is that\nassertion is demonstrably false. imagine, for example, that your\nfather was murdered. your mother can remarry, but that doesn't mean\nthat the surrogate father is as wealthy as the last, or as kind, or as\nintelligence et cetera . quite stupid if i may say so. you don't know\nmuch about warfare. i glad i find everything you type to incredibly\npatronising you are an incredulous fellow, it seems. and you (or\nbohemian) do? we accept what has been said by western intelligence\nagencies and al qaeda themselves: that to some degree, osama bin laden\nwas involved in the leadership of the latter. i'm well bloody aware it\ncannot be both and this just proves you havent been readin my\nresponses as if you had you'd know i think it is either/or. of course,\nevery inconsistency in your argument (and there are many) is my fault.\nyes and im sure he has criticised the liberals, god knows who else.\nthe politics of the left are only slightly less ludicrous than the\npolitics of the right. you don't understand my position at all. you\nare whining now. your position is a ridiculous rejection of everything\nthe united states and british governments and intelligence agencies\nsay, fanciful speculation on the organisation of al qaeda, a litany of\nthreadbare insults and accusations, irrelevant cases of united states\nforeign meddling and a perverse refusal to acknowledge the fluidity of\nallegiance and motivation. i wouldnt say that the fact that\nwashingtone falsely claimed that saddam hussein was in collaboration\nwith al queda top officials prior to the invasion (or have you\nforgotten those old lies) qualifies as \"virtually no connection to the\namerican's portrayal of osama bin laden\", in fact i think it\nqualifies, and whats more i do beleiv i just caught you by your\nballsack my friend whether your big enough to admit it or not. got\nyou. every chapter of al qaeda was not solely controlled by osama bin\nladen and they never were. he was involved specifically with the\nchapter that operates out of afghanistan/pakistan. the americans knew\nthis, and did not say otherwise.\nhttp://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/crt/2005/ 64344.htm\nhttp://www.globalsecurity.org/security/ profiles/al-qaeda_in_iraq.htm\nhttp://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0514/ p03s01-usfp.html i was going to\nrespond to the rest of your post, but that seems to be a fruitless\nprospect, given that you don't even know what the united states said\nto justify their invasion of iraq (primarily, it was an allegation of\nwmd production). so you see, your inane accusations about iraq are all\nquite irrelevant."

                " this is long, but, i hope it gives you valuable thoughts. i have\nconcerns about trump, mostly on his articulation and experience, not\njust political experience but just being adequately studied on\npolitical procedure and current events. he would need a really strong\ncabinet, in areas he's not strong in. but as far as the statement you\nmade here, it\u2019s not actually a real or accurate evaluation of trump\nnor the situation surrounding trump. these statement and other\naccusations are not sensible, logical arguments. trump actually wants\nto protect people\u2019s rights. including women and blacks. you have to\nunderstand the personality of trump\u2026. i\u2019m a women and he doesn\u2019t\nbother me. he is a hot head. he is not politically correct. he steps\nin shit when he opens his mouth, not because his motives are bad or\nevil, not because he is a dictator, and not because he's a racist, or\nhates women. it\u2019s because he never really had to package his words\ncarefully, and he didn\u2019t intend to run for office. i\u2019m not saying\ntrump is qualified in my opinion to be president. but, i am saying:\nmany things you see at this time are provoked. he, trump, is a hot\nhead, he is provoked. black lives matter are hotheads they are\nprovoked. and they exploit and media exploits. much is taken out of\ncontext. many things trump has ever said in the past is just trump\nbeing trump. a celebrity, a big talker, a hot head, a real estate\ntycoon, a guy from new york. to vilifying trump is actually inaccurate\nand off base. he is not, and he should not be an excuse for a bunch of\npeople to make a platform, and lead the country by \u201cmob rules\nbehavior,\u201d and \u201cforce a power of influence and authority\u201d over\neveryone, through intimidation. i do have logically based concerns\nabout trump as president. such as \u2013 cruz brought to our attention that\ntrump is in litigation and may be sued for an expensive real estate\ncourse he ran, so being involved in that, depending on the details may\nbe a true, tangible, measurable and factual concern. the series of off\nthe cuff remarks made through his lifetime, many out of context, and\nothers in my opinion are just mouthy hot head words without a\npolitically correct filter! i didn\u2019t like his reaction to meagan kelly\nduring and after the first debate. but i don't see it as \u201chating women\nor devaluing women,\u201d i see it as he was backed into a corner, and he\nreally isn\u2019t accustomed to. and he doesn't adjust his reactions. he\nsimply is just rash, with brute honesty, wears his feelings and\nattitudes on his sleeve, and honestly just opens his mouth and steps\nin shit, and he does so in reaction at the moment, and in the heat of\nthe moment. trump is like many people i have experienced, and maybe,\neven a little like myself. so i get the crap that falls out of his\nmouth in the heat of the moment. but to vilify him by these things is\nmore of a salem witch hunt, than a true reasonable evaluation. i can\nsee why some people would say or feel things they do, or form opinions\nby what he has said or says. but there is a huge overreaction to all\nof it! and, it isn\u2019t balanced! here is trump in a nutshell: he is a\nhigh d personality traitss with a secondary high i personality traits\nhe has a low level s personality traits he had a low level c\npersonality traits and that is most likely his disc profile. (below is\na basic view of disc personality traits) d - dominant traits i -\ninspiring traits s \u2013 serving traits c \u2013 cautious traits so, i\u2019ll\nexplain why accusing trump of having an interest or a motive in taking\nrights away is an off base accusation. 1st of all, ask yourself why???\nwhy would he? and, why would he logically want to? 1st put yourself in\nhis perspective\u2026. it may surprise you. your really not as important as\nyou think you are to trump. or, let\u2019s rephrase that to understand\nexactly what i mean by that. he actually doesn\u2019t need to be president.\ni really think trump was drinking a beer and said \u201dshit, i can fix\nthis, maybe i should run for president!\u201d there\u2019s a funny of trump\nfacebook post that says that. but, the real funny part of the post is,\ni think its closer to being true than not true!! he doesn\u2019t need to be\npresident, he doesn\u2019t need you, and he doesn\u2019t need to make you\nimportant to himself at all. he doesn\u2019t even need your approval in\nlife, and he doesn\u2019t need, or want your rights! your life, your local\neconomy, your future security, your unemployment or your ability or\ninability to charge a reasonable bid as a handyman because of\ncompeting below market bids on projects by under the table alien\nworkers - that take away your jobs and your income potential and then\nleave you at a disadvantage, unable to take care of yourself and your\nfamily! none of these things, that affect you, actually will ever\naffect trump or his family, at all. if mexican immigrants get the jobs\nyou didn\u2019t get. trump doesn\u2019t have to pay your mortgage, your\nelectric, your grocery bill, and your education etc\u2026 to trump, whether\nyou have a job or not, really doesn\u2019t have any effect on trump\u2019s life\nnor anyone he cares about! as far as terrorism, and your safe\ntraveling on commercial airplanes, that is the least important thing\npersonally to trump! why? because he actually has his own plane! he\ndoesn\u2019t need or want your social security check, your unemployment\ncheck, he doesn\u2019t have to pay your healthcare or obamacare premiums,\nhe doesn\u2019t compete in your job market, he doesn\u2019t walk your streets\nand encounter your neighborhood crime, nor does he encounter your\nareas crime done by undocumented immigrants. the reality is, some\nillegals are or could be potential rapists murderers or thieves! wait\na minute, how dare he say that about illegal aliens, you bigot. there\ni said it for you! now, you wait a minute. here is some common sense\nthoughts you should also consider when forming your opinions.\nactually, illegals come in the usa, without required records. we have\nno idea who or where they are, and we have no ability to do any\nhomework on them, on their background, or even varify their real\nnames! because there is no id or passport required when you are\nillegal! so, through legal immigration, we are more able to reject the\nentrance of criminals, and drug smugglers. another thought, and please\nunderstand, i\u2019m making a point not being cruel. but, the ones who come\nillegally, come from the poorest and most crime ridden areas of\nmexico. these are the people who are the least likely to ever afford\nto come legally. now, make comparisons between illegals and legals.\nallowing legals in the usa - we have more ability to vet them and\nreject criminals, because it is required that they have records, and\nids and a passports. but illegals, there is a higher chance of letting\nin criminals. why? 1 - because criminals can\u2019t easily come here\nlegally, so they have to come illegally and 2 - most illegals are\ncoming from the poorest areas that have the highest concentration of\ncrime. and illegals are traveling from these areas and with criminals.\nwhat they are fleeing, high crime, and poverty and desperation is what\nthey are bringing with them. without our ability to vet them, no\nrecords, no health records, no criminal backgrounds, no proof of id or\npassports! and 3 - mwxico is more than happy to send their criminals\nover to be our problem, instead of theirs! back to trump: he is a\ncitizen like us, looking at areas the usa is messing up, and he is\nlooking at these big problems, and his possible solutions as a\nmotivation and a platform, and he thinks he can fix it. whether he can\nor not, isn\u2019t relevant at the moment. because, what we are discussing\nhere is... when you slice up trump what is inside. his motives? his\nwhy? he didn\u2019t just decide to run to prove himself. he actually\ndoesn\u2019t need to prove himself, especially not to you or me. he didn\u2019t\ndecide i feel like spending millions in running for president, because\nthat would be a prestigeous thing to do. he is business wealthy, not\npolitician wealthy. politicians have career goas leading to a\npresidential dreams. trump probably didn\u2019t have becoming president on\nhis career goal list, and probably not even on his jump out of a\nplane, ride the biggest roller coaster, buy an island \u2026. and\neverything else, bucket list! trumps business background: many\nsuccessful people had bankruptcies and use legal loopholes to build\nbusinesses. and atlantic city has been put out of business just about,\natlantic city is a big mess in the tristate area. because states who\ndidn\u2019t allow gambling, now do. so there are more local options for\ngambling and less people doing to atlantic city. so atlantic city\ntanked, atlantic municipality actually just shut down and closed their\ngovernment doors (for months or maybe more) because literally, their\nbroke! so regardless, trump had great success, and is a business man.\nand, managing a big budget, of many businesses all at 1 time, and\nlowering expenses and deficiencies is something that is actually in\nhis wheelhouse! these are areas he sees as things that someone needs\nto step up and fix around here in the usa. now, he is approaching\nissues from a citizens perspective and business perspective and he is\nthinking, \"i can fix this. someone has to get this stuff under a\nmanageable control,\" ....or america may face bankruptcy, bad credit,\ngovernment shut downs, refusal of future credit, or have no ability to\nborrow, maybe foreclosure (of a country?), or the inability to pay\nsalaries, or provide benefits or funding or care or social security\nchecks or welfare checks or unemployment checks, or health care\npremiums for obamacare\u2026 etc. he sees policies that are hurting\namericans, and his approach is from a common sense citizen and a\nbusiness perspective: 1- trading and american businesses \u2013 trading\ngoods with china and others, and american companies who brought their\nbusiness to other countries, (trump has bought, sold, and run\ncompanies abroad also) so as a business person he answers the problem\nby strategies to strengthen opportunities, jobs, and make and sell\nmore products locally, to strengthen our economy, reduce inflation,\nand make life more affordable for everybody. make sense? this is a\nreasonable approach. and, this approach isn't selective help according\nto race, gender, sex orientation etc\u2026 because it will help everyone\nacross the board, and raise many black and white people out of\npoverty, and there will be more money in our economy, in our local\ncommunities, and in households, and probably significantly will raise\ntax revenue from everyone, and for everyone\u2019s benefit. bringing\nbusinesses home raise tax revenue from big business, which is big\nmoney, to add to our american pocketbook. 2- immigration - he doesn't\nhate mexicans, and he doesn't hate muslims. he hates \u201cthe problems\u201d we\nhave, that happen to include some people from these 2 groups. again,\nhe is using a common sense citizen/businessman approach to problems\nand solutions. so 1st, lets all get in the driver seat, and lets all\nmake the most logical determination for policies, in response to \u201call\nthe problems.\u201d in our homes we can't pay the electric bill, and ignore\nthe water bill. but, if push comes to shove, we may do without a\ndinner out, or maybe, even do without cable tv for a few months. these\nare logical household management decisions that we all may have had to\nmake at sometime. apply the same principles to our problems in the\nusa. in the same way, we have to divide our resources, and address\neverything and every problem in balance, according to priority and our\nfuture stability and safety. so when discussing the issue of\nimmigration - 1st we have to define the problems and 2nd we have to\nanswer the problem. and we have to answer the problem with 1st making\nsure \u201cour own house\u201d has a reasonable ability to survive and thrive.\nand if we spread ourselves thin, that it\u2019s not too thin, and it won't\nadd more damages to our already struggling family! - so, then\nregarding 1 problem with many sub- problems immigration: illegal\naliens, the potential for terrorism, the vetting process, the current\njob market in the usa, our own crime and then the added crime of some\nillegal aliens, our own struggles within our own communities and our\nown country - racial tensions, poverty, education, home land security,\nlaw enforcement, health insurance, medicare, our seniors,\nunemployment, underemploymwnt, international relationships, any and\nall issues, threats, and tensions, our military defense, intelligence,\nand military responsibilities and action, green card holders, and\nmore... etc... (reduce it all to small terms and apply a common sense\nexample) - we have a good little family, we are compassionate and help\nothers. but we have a limit on ability. we have limits on the good we\ncan do, and regardless of what we would like to do, the good we can do\nis limited by our ability and resources. we are limited by our own\nincome, our bills, our discretionary income, our by our own progress\nand goals as a family unit, and of each individual person within our\nown family. we also have many other obligations - our aging parents,\nother people that are directly in our path that have needs, planning\nour own years of retirement, and personal and our children\u2019s\neducation, and providing for the now and later needs and wants and\ngoals for ourselves, our children, and our grandchildren, and then\nalso more, other community involvements we are a part of like churches\nor other groups and charities that are important to us ... then\nwhatever is left over after we have met or managed the immediate\ndemands around us, what is leftover if any, is all that we have to\nwork with. we all have to understand, we just can't give everyone a\nbetter life, because 1 - it is not realistic 2 - it will hurt our\nimmediate and extended family. it would take from their basic needs,\nand also would put their future stability at risk 3 - it would prevent\nstability and goals both collectively and personally. hurting our\neconomic improvements, current growth, and future gains. well, the\ngovernment spending and budget- federal, state, and local are similar\nin comparison, but just on a way bigger and broader scale! so, when\ntrump says, \"close the boarder\" and \"build a wall,\" he isn't being\ncallus or a bigot. he is taking each of these real issues, i\nmentioned, effecting immigration and he is applying a common sense\napproach for answers according to the whole picture of immigration\ncombined with the whole picture of all the other issues in light of\nour household budget, our projected future earnings, and our already\naccrued rising national debt, along with the interest on the money we\nalready owe - (which is billions and growing by adding on top growing\nunpaid interest and also more added new debt from all the short falls\nfrom yearly spending we don\u2019t cover now by tax revenue. so this is our\nhousehold budget, and our spending and our bills are not even close to\nbeing covered. the debt grows and grows with what we don\u2019t cover in\ntaxes after our bills are paid. and that is huge!! so take issues\nsurrounding immigration, and answer it. understand the why, ask more\nquestions, see what we are willing to do without, an what we can\u2019t di\nwithout. and if you cut from priority areas, like military or\nretirement social security or medicare or education. make sure you ask\nmore questions and more question and weigh every possible problem or\nconsequence. before you make your opinion and chase idiot know it\nalls, that actually are likely the least educated among us. maybe even\nenemies of america for all you know!",

who cares if the checker at macy\u2019s wishes us a\nmerry christmas, sounds right? but see, that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening.\n\u201cmerry christmas\u201d has become politically incorrect. and banned!\n\"politically correct\" has become the standard, acceptable speech, it\nhas become freedom of speech censorship! society and even government\ncourts have allowed the supression of christian religious freedoms.\nso, pressure is so great in our society to be absent of christianity\neverywhere in public, that many stores now are forbidding employees to\nsay \u201cmerry christmas\u201d which tramples on the employees rights, and the\ncustomers rights! are we, or arent we a tolerant society? why is it\neven considered allowed or in any way acceptable in our american\nsociety, let alone passed in courts in some areas; where a \u201cchristmas\ntree\u201d is banned in our public square?!?!? christmas is exclusively a\nchristian holiday. no matter how commercialized, dec 25th is a date we\nchose as a holiday to honor the birth of jesus. no matter what reason\nwe chose the date, its actually none of anyone\u2019s business to question\nor speculate our doctrines of faith, your only responsibility on\nthings like this here in our free country is to be tolerant, and not\nsuppress religion in our free society. well it was a festival for\npagans, then christianity replaced the druid holiday... blah blah\nblah. but look, it doesn\u2019t matter why we picked the date. its our\ndoctrine of faith, and as far back as before america was even found,\nchristians celebrated christmas day! and its none of anyone\u2019s business\nif it was in a different date in rome or another date in england. and\nnow dec. 25th that\u2019s our business! the point is it became dec 25th is\nthe date we chose to celebrate our doctrine of faith regarding the\nbirth of jesus, it is our holiday! and you have no right to deny us\nour rights! it is a holiday that honors the birth of jesus. secular\nand the non religious are welcome to celebrate it as well, any way you\nlike, but you are not welcome to force us christians to conform our\nholiday to your anti religious secular idea of our holiday! live and\nlet live! and since it's our christian holiday, we get to celebrate it\npublicly without suppression and we can publically everywhere we go\ncall it christmas!!! in school, at work, in the dmv, anywhere we are.\nand without anyone at all able to force us to not discuss it or call\nit anything else, but what it is christmas!!!! since when is it ok to\nrequire the renaming of a holiday belonging to any particular\nreligious or even cultural group? isn\u2019t forcing christians to be\nsilenced and unseen by our \u201csupposedly tolerant society\u201d an assault\nagainst religious freedom? making christians conform to anti religious\nideas, or to conform their holiday to other non christian religions,\nis absolutely a big deal, its an assault to the freedom of religion!\nit\u2019s the erosion of religious freedom that has progressed, a little\nmore, and a little more each year! it\u2019s truly pick pocketing american\ncitizens of our constitutional rights! this has become an anti\nchristian society, and has boldly infiltrated into every area of our\nsociety. and it is in-tolerant of christians and christian faith(s).\nif religion is censored then that is religious supression. it is an\nassault on religious rights and freedoms! and it has become and is\nheavily censored today more than ever! society applies harsh pressures\nagainst christian religion and religious open free expression, and\nthat is an assault! its purpose is to remove religion, specifically\nchristian religions from our society! \u201cchrist\u201d in \u201cchristmas\u201d is this\nholiday. to honor america\u2019s christian citizens, and to not suppress\ntheir religious freedom, society needs to let christian faith be open\namong us, and to be \u201ctolerant\u201d of our religious culture. 3 americans\nshould protect the holiday \u201cchrist\u201dmas, and protect the freedoms of\nthe christians that celebrate it! it is not constitutional to suppress\nthis common celebration by christians on dec 25th. many, many, many\nchurches in america celebrate this christian holiday. none of us\nchristians demand non christian to celebrate christmas, its optional\nif you\u2019d like to or not, it\u2019s up to you. and you can call it anything\nyou want. but, you can\u2019t suppress christians from publically\ndisplaying their christian celebration and publically calling it\nchristmas! and how aren\u2019t we more concerned? are we that apathetic\nconcerning constitutional rights? why does the word \u201cchristmas\u201d need\nto be forced to conform to fit everyone in our society, and at the\nexpense of our religious freedom, and at the expense of our open\npublic celebration of our faith, christianity, and our christmas\nholiday? articles representing our basic common principles, found in\nneutral articles of faith like the 10 commandments, or right hand on\nthe bible in court proceedings are under constant threat of removal\nalong with articles celebrating holidays like christmas. there is\nabsolutely no threat to celebrating christmas. i said enough on this\nin above response we gave success to commercializing christmas through\nour giving gifts in honor of our faith. we are the force behind \u201cred\nto black\u201d of black friday, padding the financials of many successful\nservices, entertainment, and retail sales. this is not restricting\nyour religious rights. again response above, can you please give\ndetails after reading my points, and if you are not convinced of my\nopinion, then please present a relative argument. 83% of americans\nidentify themselves with christian judeo faiths. but, representations\nof judeo christianity seen or acknowledged visibility in our society\nis offensive and suppressed by the scientifically oriented atheist.\nwho claim any display of faith offends them, and they feel they have a\nreligious right to \"not be offended\" by the religious culture within\nour society. you are not being suppressed. 1st of all i don't\npersonally need to be supressed to stand for freedom of religion.\ninaction and apathy are irresponsible. here are some examples of real,\nand current religious rights under attack in america taken from links\nabove: !! \"california christians found \u201cnot guilty\u201d of reading bible\nnear government offices: \"a court has said that a pair of christians\nwere \u2018allowed\u2019 to read the bible aloud outside the department of motor\nvehicles in hemet, california. wasn\u2019t it kind of the government courts\nin california to say that these christians were allowed to have their\nrights to free religious expression? ...back in 2011 mark mackey and\nbret coronado were arrested and charged with misdemeanor offenses for\nreading the bible outside the dmv location. ... but on august 13,\nsuperior court judge timothy freer found the men \u2018not guilty\u2019 of any\noffenses. ...interestingly, the judge also pointed out that the law\nprosecutors tried to invoke was likely unconstitutional as it gave law\nenforcement overbroad powers to quash public gatherings in the first\nplace. sadly, this case did not go toward settling the\nconstitutionality of the law, but it was a victory of sorts to have\nthe judge even mention the fact.\" yes, there were actually americans\narrested for reading the bible on public property. what do you think\nthe chances are that two muslims reading the quran would have been\narrested under the same circumstances?\" !! \"1) florida ministry told\nto choose between jesus and helping the poor:\u201d for the past 31 years,\nthe christian ministry has been providing food to the hungry in lake\ncity, fla. without any problems. but all that changed when they said a\nstate government worker showed up to negotiate a new contract. ... (a)\nstate agriculture department official told them they would not be\nallowed to receive usda food unless they removed portraits of christ,\nthe ten commandments, a banner that read 'jesus is lord' and stopping\ngiving bibles to the needy.\" when the government tells the christian\nservice center it has to give up on christ or quit using usda food to\nhelp the poor, that\u2019s religious discrimination. !! so therefore. every\nyear atheist raise more and more objections. they claim to need\nprotections from being publically offended. they suppress faith in\nevery community, accusing any evidence or thread of faith robs them of\ntheir right to live amongst us, their religious neighbors, because any\ndign of faith in god anywhere and everywhere offends them! there is\nnot a shred of truth to this claim.\" yes they do, there are many law\nsuits per year inhibiting the expression of christian faith from\neverywhere it is openly professed. and some of those law suits were\nsuccessful. political correct speech polices every word spoken, and\nsuppresses the freedom of speech. binding it by politically incorrect\ndefinitions and accusing everyday words spoken not ill intended. they\naccuse people using common phrases of being motivated by racism,\ndisrespect, and discrimination. if you don't go to jail your right to\nspeech is not violated. no but society applies bully like behavior\ntoward anyone using words, or phrases, or any speech, (written or\nspoken) to intimidate and censor.;and that is a type of restraint.\nsome people have lost jobs, positions, scholarships, and all kinds of\npunishments as a result of an increasingly overbearing society\npolicing speech. a growing monster of censorship and a witch hunt have\nbeen let loose on well meaning citizens. people who just said\nsomething the wrong way, or used a \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d word! and\nwe shouldn\u2019t have our words censored anyway! hate speech threats and\novert words of prejudice, yes. but that\u2019s the extent of acceptability.\nwe should not accept censorship of our speech! do you think it is ok\nto say naughty words like fuck or shit? people can say those words if\nthey want. there is no law against words. but if you talk like that at\nchuckey cheese, the mouse will probably ask you to leave. and chuckee\ncheese has every right to make you leave. and that\u2019s not what i\u2019m\ntalking about. i\u2019m from a phila suburb. i have said \u201cyouz guys\u201d my\nwhole life. it\u2019s common around here, and if you say that now, which i\nof course do, to or are overheard saying by it by a militant\npolitically correct feminist, you may experience harsh society\nshaming, society censorship. regardless if \"youz guys\" is a neutral\nphrase in your manner of speech and area. \"youz guys\" as i have always\nheard and used it as referring to a group with non specific gender.\nbut because \u201cguys\u201d is frequently defined to be just males, it's\npolitically incorrect and discrimination, (ignoring the girls in the\ngroup) and it doesn\u2019t matter what i meant or am used to! so we have to\nlearn to be careful of every inocent word and overthink everything\nthat comes out of our mouths. isnt that an unwarranted restraint and a\nprison of us and of speech! we are being shamed to control speech to\nonly allow speech accepted within a standard of politically correct\ncensorship, or face peer shaming from society! so, what does this\nmean, we loose free speech or we face society shaming! now, lets apply\nsociety shaming and pollitical correctness to matters of public\nsafety!!! san bernardino faced a militant style islamic radical terror\nattack a few years ago. the muslim couple were planning the attack,\nstock piling weapons in their garage. several different neighbors, who\nliterally had concerns about packages and activity at the their\nmuslim\u2019s neighbors house, failed to act on their suspicions. if they\nhad, several people would not have died or been injured. and the best\npart of the story is muslim\u2019s like this couple have actually said they\nare comfortable here in america and have less fear of being caught\nhere in america than elsewhere. why? because they feel protected,\nbecause of the personality of americans, they would choose to be\nsilent before being considered a racist, or a racial profilers, or say\nanything related to muslims in order to avoid being politically\nincorrect, and will avoid society shaming at all cost. so these\nneighbors allowed a tragedy like this, rather than alert authorities\nand face the potential risk of appearing politically incorrect. and\nnot just 1 neighbor, several neighbors! so if politically correct and\nincorrect speech has that much censorship influence, don\u2019t you think\nit\u2019s a big bully problem. it doesn\u2019t have to be penned into a law to\nbe an assault on the freedom of speech!*"

                " you can't twist law to coform to a religious belief. and you can't\ncreate a law in respect of a religion. thats not constitutional. your\npost is almost crazy paranoid, when really its the other way around\nthat is more likely concern. it's an absurd line of thought. its like\nyou all don't know what to yell about next. there is no such thing as\nmaking society conform to a narrow view of religion through\ngovernment. what would religion force that is a narrow view? cultural\nstandards of right and wrong, moral authority, kindness and charity\nare defined from something and from somewhere. and your concience is\nyour adjuster, it keeps you within acceptable standards, its your bar\nyou reach for. it also the standard inside yourself that corrects you\nwhen you go below acceptable standards. if you gathered these values\nfrom your christian parents, whether you like it or not, it was the\ncultural influence that defined your concious. you answer to something\ninside. our laws are based on moral concience of right and wrong, as\ndefined within judeo christian standards of morality. the value of\nhuman life, the freedom of choice by free will, judicial fairness in\ntrials and punishment, the golden rule, rights, tolerance, promises,\nresponsibilities, actions, and reactions. high standards and also low\nstandards of conduct are defined within you by the acceptable norm of\ncultural standards. separation of church and state doesn't have very\nmuch to do with standard of right and wrong. we don't create laws\nbased on a specific religion, and we don't allow specific religious\ndoctrine to apply when in contradiction to law. issues of abortion and\ngay marriage, you don't have to be religious to agree or disagree with\neither of these. aboruntion from an economic standpoint is wasteful,\nand morally, i personally believe life starts at conception. i oppose\nabortion beyond the morning after pill. and birthcontrol is both\neconomically sound and morally sound. but these issues are neither\nreligious government or secular government. we are not secular. we\nhave moral roots that define our basic definition of right and wrong,\nand fair and unfair. and that is the standard of cultural norm in\namerican society. none of like when people don't keep an acceptable\nlevel of our cultural standard. we apply our law as common sense, a\nguide of concience. how often do we have to look up a law to tell us\nright or wrong. and how often does society punish through the courts\nwhen someone is acting in good concience according to our cultural\nnorm? even atheists who come from a family of atheist, in america, are\ngoverned by the cultural norm of right and wrong, which is based on\nvalues with roots in judaism and christianity. look at israel,\npredominately high moral standards and high values regarding life. the\nstandard of cultural norm of right and wrong, is very different than\nthe countries that surround them. look at countries that surround\nthem, more serial killers in 1 area the size of a town than all of\namerica has born in a lifetime.",
                " this is long, but, i hope it gives you valuable thoughts. i have\nconcerns about trump, mostly on his articulation and experience, not\njust political experience but just being adequately studied on\npolitical procedure and current events. he would need a really strong\ncabinet, in areas he's not strong in. but as far as the statement you\nmade here, it\u2019s not actually a real or accurate evaluation of trump\nnor the situation surrounding trump. these statement and other\naccusations are not sensible, logical arguments. trump actually wants\nto protect people\u2019s rights. including women and blacks. you have to\nunderstand the personality of trump\u2026. i\u2019m a women and he doesn\u2019t\nbother me. he is a hot head. he is not politically correct. he steps\nin shit when he opens his mouth, not because his motives are bad or\nevil, not because he is a dictator, and not because he's a racist, or\nhates women. it\u2019s because he never really had to package his words\ncarefully, and he didn\u2019t intend to run for office. i\u2019m not saying\ntrump is qualified in my opinion to be president. but, i am saying:\nmany things you see at this time are provoked. he, trump, is a hot\nhead, he is provoked. black lives matter are hotheads they are\nprovoked. and they exploit and media exploits. much is taken out of\ncontext. many things trump has ever said in the past is just trump\nbeing trump. a celebrity, a big talker, a hot head, a real estate\ntycoon, a guy from new york. to vilifying trump is actually inaccurate\nand off base. he is not, and he should not be an excuse for a bunch of\npeople to make a platform, and lead the country by \u201cmob rules\nbehavior,\u201d and \u201cforce a power of influence and authority\u201d over\neveryone, through intimidation. i do have logically based concerns\nabout trump as president. such as \u2013 cruz brought to our attention that\ntrump is in litigation and may be sued for an expensive real estate\ncourse he ran, so being involved in that, depending on the details may\nbe a true, tangible, measurable and factual concern. the series of off\nthe cuff remarks made through his lifetime, many out of context, and\nothers in my opinion are just mouthy hot head words without a\npolitically correct filter! i didn\u2019t like his reaction to meagan kelly\nduring and after the first debate. but i don't see it as \u201chating women\nor devaluing women,\u201d i see it as he was backed into a corner, and he\nreally isn\u2019t accustomed to. and he doesn't adjust his reactions. he\nsimply is just rash, with brute honesty, wears his feelings and\nattitudes on his sleeve, and honestly just opens his mouth and steps\nin shit, and he does so in reaction at the moment, and in the heat of\nthe moment. trump is like many people i have experienced, and maybe,\neven a little like myself. so i get the crap that falls out of his\nmouth in the heat of the moment. but to vilify him by these things is\nmore of a salem witch hunt, than a true reasonable evaluation. i can\nsee why some people would say or feel things they do, or form opinions\nby what he has said or says. but there is a huge overreaction to all\nof it! and, it isn\u2019t balanced! here is trump in a nutshell: he is a\nhigh d personality traitss with a secondary high i personality traits\nhe has a low level s personality traits he had a low level c\npersonality traits and that is most likely his disc profile. (below is\na basic view of disc personality traits) d - dominant traits i -\ninspiring traits s \u2013 serving traits c \u2013 cautious traits so, i\u2019ll\nexplain why accusing trump of having an interest or a motive in taking\nrights away is an off base accusation. 1st of all, ask yourself why???\nwhy would he? and, why would he logically want to? 1st put yourself in\nhis perspective\u2026. it may surprise you. your really not as important as\nyou think you are to trump. or, let\u2019s rephrase that to understand\nexactly what i mean by that. he actually doesn\u2019t need to be president.\ni really think trump was drinking a beer and said \u201dshit, i can fix\nthis, maybe i should run for president!\u201d there\u2019s a funny of trump\nfacebook post that says that. but, the real funny part of the post is,\ni think its closer to being true than not true!! he doesn\u2019t need to be\npresident, he doesn\u2019t need you, and he doesn\u2019t need to make you\nimportant to himself at all. he doesn\u2019t even need your approval in\nlife, and he doesn\u2019t need, or want your rights! your life, your local\neconomy, your future security, your unemployment or your ability or\ninability to charge a reasonable bid as a handyman because of\ncompeting below market bids on projects by under the table alien\nworkers - that take away your jobs and your income potential and then\nleave you at a disadvantage, unable to take care of yourself and your\nfamily! none of these things, that affect you, actually will ever\naffect trump or his family, at all. if mexican immigrants get the jobs\nyou didn\u2019t get. trump doesn\u2019t have to pay your mortgage, your\nelectric, your grocery bill, and your education etc\u2026 to trump, whether\nyou have a job or not, really doesn\u2019t have any effect on trump\u2019s life\nnor anyone he cares about! as far as terrorism, and your safe\ntraveling on commercial airplanes, that is the least important thing\npersonally to trump! why? because he actually has his own plane! he\ndoesn\u2019t need or want your social security check, your unemployment\ncheck, he doesn\u2019t have to pay your healthcare or obamacare premiums,\nhe doesn\u2019t compete in your job market, he doesn\u2019t walk your streets\nand encounter your neighborhood crime, nor does he encounter your\nareas crime done by undocumented immigrants. the reality is, some\nillegals are or could be potential rapists murderers or thieves! wait\na minute, how dare he say that about illegal aliens, you bigot. there\ni said it for you! now, you wait a minute. here is some common sense\nthoughts you should also consider when forming your opinions.\nactually, illegals come in the usa, without required records. we have\nno idea who or where they are, and we have no ability to do any\nhomework on them, on their background, or even varify their real\nnames! because there is no id or passport required when you are\nillegal! so, through legal immigration, we are more able to reject the\nentrance of criminals, and drug smugglers. another thought, and please\nunderstand, i\u2019m making a point not being cruel. but, the ones who come\nillegally, come from the poorest and most crime ridden areas of\nmexico. these are the people who are the least likely to ever afford\nto come legally. now, make comparisons between illegals and legals.\nallowing legals in the usa - we have more ability to vet them and\nreject criminals, because it is required that they have records, and\nids and a passports. but illegals, there is a higher chance of letting\nin criminals. why? 1 - because criminals can\u2019t easily come here\nlegally, so they have to come illegally and 2 - most illegals are\ncoming from the poorest areas that have the highest concentration of\ncrime. and illegals are traveling from these areas and with criminals.\nwhat they are fleeing, high crime, and poverty and desperation is what\nthey are bringing with them. without our ability to vet them, no\nrecords, no health records, no criminal backgrounds, no proof of id or\npassports! and 3 - mwxico is more than happy to send their criminals\nover to be our problem, instead of theirs! back to trump: he is a\ncitizen like us, looking at areas the usa is messing up, and he is\nlooking at these big problems, and his possible solutions as a\nmotivation and a platform, and he thinks he can fix it. whether he can\nor not, isn\u2019t relevant at the moment. because, what we are discussing\nhere is... when you slice up trump what is inside. his motives? his\nwhy? he didn\u2019t just decide to run to prove himself. he actually\ndoesn\u2019t need to prove himself, especially not to you or me. he didn\u2019t\ndecide i feel like spending millions in running for president, because\nthat would be a prestigeous thing to do. he is business wealthy, not\npolitician wealthy. politicians have career goas leading to a\npresidential dreams. trump probably didn\u2019t have becoming president on\nhis career goal list, and probably not even on his jump out of a\nplane, ride the biggest roller coaster, buy an island \u2026. and\neverything else, bucket list! trumps business background: many\nsuccessful people had bankruptcies and use legal loopholes to build\nbusinesses. and atlantic city has been put out of business just about,\natlantic city is a big mess in the tristate area. because states who\ndidn\u2019t allow gambling, now do. so there are more local options for\ngambling and less people doing to atlantic city. so atlantic city\ntanked, atlantic municipality actually just shut down and closed their\ngovernment doors (for months or maybe more) because literally, their\nbroke! so regardless, trump had great success, and is a business man.\nand, managing a big budget, of many businesses all at 1 time, and\nlowering expenses and deficiencies is something that is actually in\nhis wheelhouse! these are areas he sees as things that someone needs\nto step up and fix around here in the usa. now, he is approaching\nissues from a citizens perspective and business perspective and he is\nthinking, \"i can fix this. someone has to get this stuff under a\nmanageable control,\" ....or america may face bankruptcy, bad credit,\ngovernment shut downs, refusal of future credit, or have no ability to\nborrow, maybe foreclosure (of a country?), or the inability to pay\nsalaries, or provide benefits or funding or care or social security\nchecks or welfare checks or unemployment checks, or health care\npremiums for obamacare\u2026 etc. he sees policies that are hurting\namericans, and his approach is from a common sense citizen and a\nbusiness perspective: 1- trading and american businesses \u2013 trading\ngoods with china and others, and american companies who brought their\nbusiness to other countries, (trump has bought, sold, and run\ncompanies abroad also) so as a business person he answers the problem\nby strategies to strengthen opportunities, jobs, and make and sell\nmore products locally, to strengthen our economy, reduce inflation,\nand make life more affordable for everybody. make sense? this is a\nreasonable approach. and, this approach isn't selective help according\nto race, gender, sex orientation etc\u2026 because it will help everyone\nacross the board, and raise many black and white people out of\npoverty, and there will be more money in our economy, in our local\ncommunities, and in households, and probably significantly will raise\ntax revenue from everyone, and for everyone\u2019s benefit. bringing\nbusinesses home raise tax revenue from big business, which is big\nmoney, to add to our american pocketbook. 2- immigration - he doesn't\nhate mexicans, and he doesn't hate muslims. he hates \u201cthe problems\u201d we\nhave, that happen to include some people from these 2 groups. again,\nhe is using a common sense citizen/businessman approach to problems\nand solutions. so 1st, lets all get in the driver seat, and lets all\nmake the most logical determination for policies, in response to \u201call\nthe problems.\u201d in our homes we can't pay the electric bill, and ignore\nthe water bill. but, if push comes to shove, we may do without a\ndinner out, or maybe, even do without cable tv for a few months. these\nare logical household management decisions that we all may have had to\nmake at sometime. apply the same principles to our problems in the\nusa. in the same way, we have to divide our resources, and address\neverything and every problem in balance, according to priority and our\nfuture stability and safety. so when discussing the issue of\nimmigration - 1st we have to define the problems and 2nd we have to\nanswer the problem. and we have to answer the problem with 1st making\nsure \u201cour own house\u201d has a reasonable ability to survive and thrive.\nand if we spread ourselves thin, that it\u2019s not too thin, and it won't\nadd more damages to our already struggling family! - so, then\nregarding 1 problem with many sub- problems immigration: illegal\naliens, the potential for terrorism, the vetting process, the current\njob market in the usa, our own crime and then the added crime of some\nillegal aliens, our own struggles within our own communities and our\nown country - racial tensions, poverty, education, home land security,\nlaw enforcement, health insurance, medicare, our seniors,\nunemployment, underemploymwnt, international relationships, any and\nall issues, threats, and tensions, our military defense, intelligence,\nand military responsibilities and action, green card holders, and\nmore... etc... (reduce it all to small terms and apply a common sense\nexample) - we have a good little family, we are compassionate and help\nothers. but we have a limit on ability. we have limits on the good we\ncan do, and regardless of what we would like to do, the good we can do\nis limited by our ability and resources. we are limited by our own\nincome, our bills, our discretionary income, our by our own progress\nand goals as a family unit, and of each individual person within our\nown family. we also have many other obligations - our aging parents,\nother people that are directly in our path that have needs, planning\nour own years of retirement, and personal and our children\u2019s\neducation, and providing for the now and later needs and wants and\ngoals for ourselves, our children, and our grandchildren, and then\nalso more, other community involvements we are a part of like churches\nor other groups and charities that are important to us ... then\nwhatever is left over after we have met or managed the immediate\ndemands around us, what is leftover if any, is all that we have to\nwork with. we all have to understand, we just can't give everyone a\nbetter life, because 1 - it is not realistic 2 - it will hurt our\nimmediate and extended family. it would take from their basic needs,\nand also would put their future stability at risk 3 - it would prevent\nstability and goals both collectively and personally. hurting our\neconomic improvements, current growth, and future gains. well, the\ngovernment spending and budget- federal, state, and local are similar\nin comparison, but just on a way bigger and broader scale! so, when\ntrump says, \"close the boarder\" and \"build a wall,\" he isn't being\ncallus or a bigot. he is taking each of these real issues, i\nmentioned, effecting immigration and he is applying a common sense\napproach for answers according to the whole picture of immigration\ncombined with the whole picture of all the other issues in light of\nour household budget, our projected future earnings, and our already\naccrued rising national debt, along with the interest on the money we\nalready owe - (which is billions and growing by adding on top growing\nunpaid interest and also more added new debt from all the short falls\nfrom yearly spending we don\u2019t cover now by tax revenue. so this is our\nhousehold budget, and our spending and our bills are not even close to\nbeing covered. the debt grows and grows with what we don\u2019t cover in\ntaxes after our bills are paid. and that is huge!! so take issues\nsurrounding immigration, and answer it. understand the why, ask more\nquestions, see what we are willing to do without, an what we can\u2019t di\nwithout. and if you cut from priority areas, like military or\nretirement social security or medicare or education. make sure you ask\nmore questions and more question and weigh every possible problem or\nconsequence. before you make your opinion and chase idiot know it\nalls, that actually are likely the least educated among us. maybe even\nenemies of america for all you know!"

( based on\nreal but more complicated story ) \u00a4 if a woman is four months pregnant\nand finds out she needs chemo-therapy which would likely kill the\nfetus, is she allowed to get it? (in some states it is against the law\nto knowingly permit a child to be exposed to a controlled substance\nwhich is not for the benefit of the child - code of alabama title 26\nsection 26-15-3.2 ) abortion advocates try to claim that abortion is\nsafer than other common forms of surgery. actually, i was claiming\nthat illegal abortions are less safe than legal ones - you disagree?\nthey ignore the fact however that patients are different, making the\ncomparison irrelevant.... i'll avoid finely \"tuning\" your information\non maternal mortality related to legal abortions and just reiterate\nthat my argument was that legal abortions are safer that illegal ones.\nas for the black vote......just how many people knew what obama was\nall about...how many voted for skin color? my argument is not that\nevery elector is a well-informed one (especially since i consider you\nto be a likely voter unless you are a jehovah's witness or one of the\nchristians that don't believe women should vote ...) it is only that\nthere was not a vast difference in the amount of ignorant voting in\n2008 which is attributable to obama's skin color compared to prior\nelections. i imagine some people voted for and against him who were\nignorant of his positions."

can you\nplease define that concept please? where does the left start and stop\nexactly. obama said he was against gay marriage just before he got\nelected. he knew that being pro gay marriage might cost him the\nelection, so he pretended to be against it. phony! as i explained in\nnumerous paragraphs in my response one elected official does not\nrepresent the left. what obama said and did is irrelevant. we did not\nelect him spokesperson for anyone who is left of center. yeah obama\nmade a cheap political calculation, and? you are the party that\nbelieves gay people should have no marriage rights and you personally\nbelieve they should be put in camps and reeducated. so for you to take\nthe highground over the left on gay marriage is adorable. sure he made\na hacky political calculation, hes a politician, they do that. but he\nultimately ended up legislating in a pro lgbt way so youre not really\nmaking a strong point. he instantly changed his toon after getting\nelected. that's not progress, that's a deceptive politician. youre\nentirely twisting what i meant. i specifically explained that its\nunfair to blame the party or the \"left\" as you call them for what\nobama did. as i explained above yes he made a cheap political\ncalculation. i am agreeing with you. i never said that was progress.\nprogress would be moving from the democratic party of 1950 which was\nanti gay marriage to 2019 where lgbt rights are a significant part of\nits social platform. progress is longterm. these same lying democrats\nhave told us time and time again how their goals are not to take our\nguns. the same way that obama lied about gay marriage, they lie about\ntheir true goals of taking our guns. obama didnt have anything to do\nwith gay marriage being implemented you know that right? and youre\nacting like his support of gay marriage comes out of nowhere suddenly\nafter hes elected. it really didnt. he didnt openly support same sex\nmarriage until 2012 after joe biden announced his support for it.\nprior to that he made several changes like repealing dont ask dont\ntell and reaffirming support and rights for civil unions. youre acting\nlike obama was totally anti gay and then the day he got elected he\nsaid \"mwahahaha i was secretly pro gay all along!\". he was quite\nclearly pro lgbt rights and civil unions and it took over 4 years and\nmany other people around him coming out in support for him to change\nhis mind. he wasnt one of the first democrats to support it he was\nactually quite late to that. your entire framing of obama and the gay\nmarriage stance is a joke frankly. when the time is right, they will\ncome out of the closet as with every other phony stance. they are\ncoming out of the closet once more while people like you insult us for\ntelling the truth! i insult you for the laughably and easily\ndemonstrably wrong things you say. like, it takes half a second of\nthinking critically or searching on google to prove most of what you\nsay entirely false. that is why you get insulted. you hold laughably\nwrong beliefs about the world around you. your beliefs are driven by\npartisan outrage and paranoia which drives you to abandon occams razer\nand see conspiracies where there are none. some of the democrat\npresidential candidates are already telling us they want to take our\nsemi automatic hunting rifles. and there are others on the same exact\ndebate stage that openly disagree with that position. the left is not\na monolith. you say it is simply changing times. i say hogwash! they\nknow exactly what they stand for but refuse to be honest with the\npeople. well you're wrong so idk what to tell you. if youre going to\nsay that politicians lie and withhold information then yes of course\nmany of them do. that isnt a thing that's exclusive to the left. but\nif you're going to say its hypocritical that 30 years ago the\ndemocrats were against gay marriage and today theyre not then thats\njust dumb. thats the distinction im making it is not called progress\nwhen politicians lie to the people. it's called corruption! see above.\nalso question, do you think its corruption to take large contributions\nfrom special interests like military equipment manufacturers, oil\ncompanies, and pharmaceutical corporations? serious question. you have\ngot to be kidding me when you sit there still denying how the vast\nvast majority of democrats support no restriction abortions every time\nthey elect those who tell us they will keep it legal. give me a break!\n\"no restriction abortion\" was from one bill in one state and i dont\nknow if you were paying attention but it got widely slammed by a good\nsegment of the left. why would you expect to understand what liberals\nand democrats talk about when you only visit right wing websites? it\nis not just a few democrat politicians who support this inhumanity!\nhttps://ballotpedia.org/abortion regulations by_state yes it is. the\nvast majority of blue states have abortion restrictions well before\nviability and have zero bills up for debate to change that. you are\nentirely making up this mass-unified support for no-restriction\nabortion. there is no consensus among the party officials and there is\nabsolutely zero consensus of any kind among the democratic voter base.\ni have yet to speak to one person on the left to any degree who\nsupports such a concept. i know its anecdotal but ffs youre deluded on\nthis point. almost the entire democrat congress supports killing\nviable babies for any reason! yeah not even remotely close when you\nelect them, you might as well be killing those viable babies yourself.\nso if all i care about is trade and i vote for a democrat but they\nhappen to do some abortion stuff i didnt support thats my fault?\nthat's dumb. by that logic your support of bush was you killing iraqi\ncivilians yourself. try being honest whith what you support just once\nin your denying life. irony",
                " this is what creates frustration and anger when debating liberals.\nwhen we dont fit into your cookie cutter fox news prepackaged liberal\nbox? when we stop you mid script to explain how youre misrepresenting\nour views and telling us what we believe when we dont actually hold\nthose beliefs? how annoying it must be to have to talk to actual\nhumans who dont just let you project your stupid caricature on them.\nmost of you deny supporting these radical liberal positions of the\ndemocrat party, yet you still vote for them! how do you know who i\nvoted for? i literally voted for a several republicans at my state and\nlocal level. you have no idea who the fuck i am or what i believe so\nstop pretending you do. you cry about how youre a conservative victim\nand the big bully liberals are after you, but did you ever stop to\nconsider that you and i could be allies on certain issues? did you\never think that maybe i actually agree with you on some things? maybe\nif you stopped running your mouth for six seconds we could establish\nsome things we agree on and you could actually make an ally instead of\nan enemy for once. you say you do not agree with trans talking with\nour children in public schools, yet you vote for these liberal\ndemocrats who can not make a speech without pandering to their lgbt\nbase. i think gay people should be able to be married and have the\nsame rights as everyone else. i think people who are gay or trans\nshould not be denied things like housing or adoption on the basis of\ntheir identity. that being said i dont like gay or trans media or\nentertainment. i find drag tasteless abhorrent and i dont think it has\nany place around children. i support politicians who support the\nthings i stated above. there is no \"put drag queens in libraries\" bill\nat the federal level. thats more of a town or state issue and so i\nvoted for republican selectmen and such. see how that works? have you\never spoke out to these democrats you vote for and tell them you do\nnot want lgbt groups going into our public schools, talking with our\nimpressionable children? yes actually i have. in anonymous\ncorrespondence. do you ever speak to the vast majority of democrat\ncongressmen who vow to keep no restriction abortions legal? no because\ni really do not care about that issue one way or another. speak out!\ntell them you will no longer vote for them until they stop supporting\nthe deaths of viabe babies for any reason! no. that's your pet issue\nnot mine. do these viable lives mean so little to you that you say\nnothing to the ones you vote to? yes actually. im not religious in any\nway whatsoever. 90% of abortions take place within the first 3 weeks\nof pregnancy. the vast astronomical overwhelming majority of abortions\nare done on clumps of cells that dont have a single working organ let\nalone a brain and a consciousness. none of the fetuses who are aborted\nwill ever exist to have known they were aborted and frankly the\nwoman's bodily autonomy rights would override its own will anyways.\nfor the 1000th time i will repeat these arguments ive already made to\nyou that you never address. the majority of the other 10% of abortions\nare done in emergency situations to save the life of the mother. youre\nmain issue is obsessing over the 1-3% of abortions that happen every\nyear that are late and not for any medically necessary reason. and i\nreally just do not care about the issue whatsoever it's people like\nyou who ignore this new age democrat party's extremism, and continue\nthis political correct nonsense being shoved down the throats of every\namerican. you ignore the republican party launching every large scale\nwar since ww2, 2 of which were for false pretenses and all of which\nwere complete failures that put over 14 trillion on the national debt.\nwhat about that extremism? you cry about \"oh wahhhh a liberal told me\nto say happy holidays instead of merry christmas\" (which nobody\nactually does by the way) and you ignore 200,000 dead civilians\nminimum in iraq. you ignore massive oil and weapon deals with saudi\narabia as we grow closer and closer to the nation with the religion\nthat you hate the most. you honestly think the main threat to this\ncountry's stability is college kids throwing milkshakes for some gay\nrights cause when we have massive attrocities, waste, and corruption\nright in front of your face. honestly take the damn blinders off and\nsee the big picture. yes, there are issues we would agree on, and i\nwould respect you for those issues if you refused to vote for the ones\npushing these issues. so its not enough that i work with you in the\nareas that we do agree, i also have to pledge to not vote or support\nanything you dont agree with. how about no? just be honest and admit\nwhat you would say to me if i voted for an admitted kkk member. you\nwould call me a racist for electing a man who would further his racist\npositions. you would be correct, but when it comes to what you support\nwith your vote, you deny it. i mean yeah but thats a pretty extreme\nexample. like, i dont agree with republicans on most issues but we\nagree on immigration. so youre free to vote for whoever you want and\non the issue of immigration we can agree in a bipartisan way. nobody\nhas to abandon their party or beliefs just to work together on a\nspecific issue. until you are honest with what you support, there can\nbe no intelligent debate. there is no such thing as a perfect\npolitical candidate. there only ends up being 2 people at the end of a\nprimary for the presidential race and you have to pick one. so you\nyourself have undoubtedly voted for someone that you had disagreements\nwith. its impossible to have a political candidate that believes\nexactly what you do on every issue. even trump you have to admit has\nat least one position you disagree with. i care most about healthcare\npolicy, environmental policy, and worker/union rights and wages in a\n21st century economy. so if i agree with a candidate on all of those\nissues but i disagree on their abortion stance im still gonna vote for\nthem. because they have more pros than cons for me. thats how it\nworks. so yeah ive voted for people that i dont entirely agree with.\nit has no bearing on what i actually feel about an issue just like who\nyou voted for has no bearing on how you actually feel about an issue.\nthe candidates we vote for dont speak for us, the represent us. theres\na difference there."

                " true, but it illustrates how liberals indoctrinate their children\ninto their worldview as well, even when it directly harms them. which\nremains wholly irrelevant to the debate. possibly, but teaching that\nhomosexuality is a sin can discourage them from becoming an active\nhomosexual prove it. sources. give it a rest, being an active\nhomosexual is only possible by either deluding or discarding any faith\nin an abrahamic religion. prove it. sources. in the west, religion is\nwhat discourages people from promiscuity. prove it. sources. being a\nhomosexual does increase your risk of hiv, even if it is a secondary\neffect. it has nothing to do with stigma, sex education, or healthcare\ndiscrimination, which have been pretty much eliminated in the last\n20-30 years... prove it. sources. since discrimination has lessened,\nso have the rates of hiv/aids transmission among homosexuals. in fact,\n\"the epidemic has become increasingly an epidemic of non-white\npopulations, of women, and of heterosexuals and injecting drug users\"\nand \"the largest proportional increase has occurred in cases\nattributed to heterosexual transmission\" ( source ). source source 1 :\noverall source 2 : nongonococcal urethritis, herpes genitalis,\npediculosis pubis, scabies, and genital warts source 3 : nongonococcal\nurethritis source 4 : syphilis source 5 : urethral chlamydia\ntrachomatis i understand it is a fallacy (no true scotsman), but you\ncan generally assume i'm excluding liberal christians when i say\n\"christians\" no, actually, i cannot. that being established, however,\ndoes not legitimize the apparent argument you are making that religion\nis non-abusive because it protects children from becoming homosexuals\n(because not all religion condemns homosexuality). you missed the\npoint, and subsequently you have lost it as well. i was not talking\nabout homosexuals. i was talking about heterosexuals. fine. my first\npoint stand here to then: so what? religion does not uniquely solve\nfor this, and it does not change the rest of the abusive nature of\nreligion at all even if it did. ...and infidelity, yes i agree. i'm\nnot supporting domestic violence, i'm addressing an apathy towards\nfatherhood. again, religion is not a unique solution to this if it is\na solution at all. even if it were a solution, this does not change\nthe rest of its abusive nature. yes i do, it is a disease. denying\nmedical treatment for a disease is abusive. mutilating someone's body,\nliterally selling them false hope that they can change genders, is\nabuse. a. transgender identities have been declassified as a mental\nillness in the dsm-v, having been replaced with \"gender dysphoria\"\nwhich references the state of discomfort that may be associated with\nthis identity. by the dsm's own admission, the only reason that gender\ndysphoria is even on the books is to retain access to medical\nresources for transgender persons who have historically been shut out\nof all forms of medical treatment (not just transitional services). b.\neven among those who consider transgenderism to be a mental illness,\nthe most effective medical treatment has consistently been identified\nas supporting the person through transition (not denying them it).\nthere has been no success is eliminating dysphoria through therapy or\nmedication, but aligning the physical self with the cognitive self has\nbeen proven to work. c. i am transgender. i was designated female at\nbirth and was raised to be a woman, but this did not prevent me from\nlater identifying as a man. i am pursuing transition, not because i\nhate my body but because that is the only way i can get other people\nto treat me as the man i am. if i could not change my body, if society\ncould accept that i am a man with a female body, i would not need to\npursue transition. as it is, failing to do so leads not just to\ninvalidation of my identity but jeopardizes my career and places my\nlife and well-being in serious risk on a regular basis. most of that\ndanger comes from conservative religious people. a. explain how b.\nyour link didn't work c. you can pretty well assume i'm not going to\nsee things your way because of an article from a california\nuniversity, just like i know full well you are not going to see things\nmy way if i just trow bible verses at you all day. i have more respect\nfor peer reviewed journals, but only if they contain statistics that\nactually support what you are trying to say. a. see b. b. apologies. i\ncannot find the original article any longer but here are additional\nsources: #1 &amp; #2 &amp; #3 . i recognize that two are abstracts,\nbut they do include citations to additional pertinent research. i\nwould also remind you that while i have at least made effort at\nprocuring evidence in my counter claim you have yet to provide any for\nyour initial claim. c. the difference between a california study and\nthe bible is that the study has been peer-reviewed and includes a\nmethodology which can be understood and critiqued, whereas the bible\nmakes no gesture towards any evidential standard at all. maybe you\nshould look up the suicide rates of housewives vs transsexuals. i do\nnot have to. as a transgender person i am already distinctly aware in\na way you could not possibly be. perhaps you should educate yourself\nas to the actual reasons for that increased prevalence: foremost among\nthem being discrimination. does it really come as any surprise to you\nthat an oppressed demographic would suffer from higher rates of\nsuicide? truly? please. another instance where you and i will just\ndisagree on what is good and what is bad, but just for fun, why don't\nyou go ahead and tell me what that better source is. i do not hold a\npersonal morality myself, and do not actually see things in terms of\ngood and bad as you do. that said, i think any secular source is\ninnately better than a theistic source because it has a greater\ncapacity for incorporating critical thought (whereas this attribute is\nanathema to religion). baseline : you have presented no evidence for\nany of your many assertions, yet make repeated calls for more\nsubstantiation of my counter claims; in truth, the primary burden of\nproof is upon you and you have utterly failed to support it. even if\neverything you have claimed were true, and even if you could then\nprove that religion is the only way to address those issues, you would\nstill not have disproved that religion can also be a form of child\nabuse on account of its other attributes (e.g. indoctrination, dogma,\nsuperstition, etc.). present proof and a coherent argument, or i am\ndisinclined to persist in listening to your espousal of uniformed and\nfrankly intolerant beliefs."

how annoying it must be to have to talk to actual\nhumans who dont just let you project your stupid caricature on them.\nmost of you deny supporting these radical liberal positions of the\ndemocrat party, yet you still vote for them! how do you know who i\nvoted for? i literally voted for a several republicans at my state and\nlocal level. you have no idea who the fuck i am or what i believe so\nstop pretending you do. you cry about how youre a conservative victim\nand the big bully liberals are after you, but did you ever stop to\nconsider that you and i could be allies on certain issues? did you\never think that maybe i actually agree with you on some things? maybe\nif you stopped running your mouth for six seconds we could establish\nsome things we agree on and you could actually make an ally instead of\nan enemy for once. you say you do not agree with trans talking with\nour children in public schools, yet you vote for these liberal\ndemocrats who can not make a speech without pandering to their lgbt\nbase. i think gay people should be able to be married and have the\nsame rights as everyone else. i think people who are gay or trans\nshould not be denied things like housing or adoption on the basis of\ntheir identity. that being said i dont like gay or trans media or\nentertainment. i find drag tasteless abhorrent and i dont think it has\nany place around children. i support politicians who support the\nthings i stated above. there is no \"put drag queens in libraries\" bill\nat the federal level. thats more of a town or state issue and so i\nvoted for republican selectmen and such. see how that works? have you\never spoke out to these democrats you vote for and tell them you do\nnot want lgbt groups going into our public schools, talking with our\nimpressionable children? yes actually i have. in anonymous\ncorrespondence. do you ever speak to the vast majority of democrat\ncongressmen who vow to keep no restriction abortions legal? no because\ni really do not care about that issue one way or another. speak out!\ntell them you will no longer vote for them until they stop supporting\nthe deaths of viabe babies for any reason! no. that's your pet issue\nnot mine. do these viable lives mean so little to you that you say\nnothing to the ones you vote to? yes actually. im not religious in any\nway whatsoever. 90% of abortions take place within the first 3 weeks\nof pregnancy. the vast astronomical overwhelming majority of abortions\nare done on clumps of cells that dont have a single working organ let\nalone a brain and a consciousness. none of the fetuses who are aborted\nwill ever exist to have known they were aborted and frankly the\nwoman's bodily autonomy rights would override its own will anyways.\nfor the 1000th time i will repeat these arguments ive already made to\nyou that you never address. the majority of the other 10% of abortions\nare done in emergency situations to save the life of the mother. youre\nmain issue is obsessing over the 1-3% of abortions that happen every\nyear that are late and not for any medically necessary reason. and i\nreally just do not care about the issue whatsoever it's people like\nyou who ignore this new age democrat party's extremism, and continue\nthis political correct nonsense being shoved down the throats of every\namerican. you ignore the republican party launching every large scale\nwar since ww2, 2 of which were for false pretenses and all of which\nwere complete failures that put over 14 trillion on the national debt.\nwhat about that extremism? you cry about \"oh wahhhh a liberal told me\nto say happy holidays instead of merry christmas\" (which nobody\nactually does by the way) and you ignore 200,000 dead civilians\nminimum in iraq. you ignore massive oil and weapon deals with saudi\narabia as we grow closer and closer to the nation with the religion\nthat you hate the most. you honestly think the main threat to this\ncountry's stability is college kids throwing milkshakes for some gay\nrights cause when we have massive attrocities, waste, and corruption\nright in front of your face. honestly take the damn blinders off and\nsee the big picture. yes, there are issues we would agree on, and i\nwould respect you for those issues if you refused to vote for the ones\npushing these issues. so its not enough that i work with you in the\nareas that we do agree, i also have to pledge to not vote or support\nanything you dont agree with. how about no? just be honest and admit\nwhat you would say to me if i voted for an admitted kkk member. you\nwould call me a racist for electing a man who would further his racist\npositions. you would be correct, but when it comes to what you support\nwith your vote, you deny it. i mean yeah but thats a pretty extreme\nexample. like, i dont agree with republicans on most issues but we\nagree on immigration. so youre free to vote for whoever you want and\non the issue of immigration we can agree in a bipartisan way. nobody\nhas to abandon their party or beliefs just to work together on a\nspecific issue. until you are honest with what you support, there can\nbe no intelligent debate. there is no such thing as a perfect\npolitical candidate. there only ends up being 2 people at the end of a\nprimary for the presidential race and you have to pick one. so you\nyourself have undoubtedly voted for someone that you had disagreements\nwith. its impossible to have a political candidate that believes\nexactly what you do on every issue. even trump you have to admit has\nat least one position you disagree with. i care most about healthcare\npolicy, environmental policy, and worker/union rights and wages in a\n21st century economy. so if i agree with a candidate on all of those\nissues but i disagree on their abortion stance im still gonna vote for\nthem. because they have more pros than cons for me. thats how it\nworks. so yeah ive voted for people that i dont entirely agree with.\nit has no bearing on what i actually feel about an issue just like who\nyou voted for has no bearing on how you actually feel about an issue.\nthe candidates we vote for dont speak for us, the represent us. theres\na difference there.",

                " your view presumes that pain is necessarily experiential rather than\nenacted. this is a cartesian understanding which views things like\npain exclusively as internal subjective experiences, however it has\nbeen contested by figures such as wittgenstein who's theory of\nlanguage situates the meaning of pain in enactment rather than\ninaccessible internal states (which the average person doesn't really\ncare about at the end of the day). your additional view that a nervous\nsystem is necessary for pain follows from the first view. but not only\nis it flawed in that respect, but it requires a further series of\nunproved connections between and assumptions about organic matter,\nnervous systems, subjective experience, and pain itself. this is an\nexpression of the same anthropocentric bias which fueled the popular\nbelief that non-human animals cannot have pain until the late 1980s\n(and which is ongoing for some species, such as shrimp). that we have\npain and also nervous systems and have drawn a connection between them\ndoes not mean that the connection actually exists (e.g. hume's theory\non causality), nor that pain is exclusively produced by such a\nconnection. the problem with a cartesian view of pain is that it's\nlogical conclusion must deny even that other humans experience pain,\nbecause we cannot directly access their subjective experience and\nthereby confirm it. although we might be persuaded to say that there\nis enough evident similarity between human beings to reasonably\nconclude that we can all have pain, that is still presumptuous and\nunproved. moreover, because the experience of pain can only ever be\nassumed and never proved it is therefore the case that what\nconstitutes sufficient similarity is entirely arbitrary. such that we\nmay as well draw the line to exclude/include other humans as to do so\nwith non-human animals or plants. in light of that, my original\nobservation deliberately couched \"experience\" in terms of\ndemonstrative behavior rather than inaccessible subjective experience.\nthe research i allude to is that which supports the view that plants\nrespond to their environment in complex ways, and until i'm sure you\nmean to contest that plants are basically adaptive i'm not going to\nput much effort into references. i suspect that you mean to express\nincredulity that any research exists showing that plants experience\npain in the way you conceive of experience and pain. to that, i\nactually agree... but the same is true of non-human animals\n(e.g.[1][2]). that is a significant reason why it took so much time\nand effort to persuade people to thinking that non-human animals\nexperience pain at all (and from there, that we should care). the\nproblem is that what constitutes pain is a philosophical rather than\nscientific question; 'pain' is just an idea we associate to some\nphenomenon which science observes that could be called out by any\nother name without altering the substance of those scientific\nobservations in the least. this creates the dilemma i identified for\nvegetarians and vegans, because they cannot deny the pain of plants\nwithout also casting doubt on the legitimacy of the pain of non-human\nanimals. this is because the two objections, while superficially\ndifferent, are ultimately predicated upon the same foundation (a\ncartesian concept of pain as experience) and the same objection\n(dissimilarity in the form of organic material constitutes doubt for\nsimilarity in experience). therefore, it is inconsistent to argue from\nan ethics of pain against eating animals but for eating plants.

teachers need to offer a balanced perspective\nleading our youth in discussions that are infused with an excitement\nabout our progress and growth. emotionally connecting our kids to our\namerican values. highlighting the many valiant acts of heroism, and\ncore values that propelled us forward, united us, and made us great.\nclass discussions should not direct the focus of our youth to protest\ntheir american heritage, but instead they should excite our kids with\npatriotism. patriotism is caught not taught. i've had many discussions\nwith my kids over their school age years. especially my youngest who\nis now 19. as a parent, i\u2019ve noticed rapid changes over the years as\nmy kids, now ages 19 to 24, came home from school. increasing over\ntheir school years more emphasis has been placed on teaching our kids\nabout mistakes made in our nations history. while also, arming them\nwith a preposterous almost militant conviction that \"our generation\"\ndidn\u2019t know the pugnacity of america hidden or twisted throughout our\neducation.\u201d these are exact misconceptions i have heard from my kids.\nthere is now similar statements echoed from many millennialist in\nonline posts and arguments that have crossed over touching uninformed\npeople in every age group. the funny thing,... i cant remember any of\nmy young generational accusers surprising me with any \"new pieces of\nhistory\" that i supposedly didn't learn. i had an average level of\nhistory education. so it should be easy to enlighten me with all those\nfacts that my teachers left out! i'm 50 years old. i learned about\nthings like immigrants, marco polo, injustices done to indians,\natrocities of slave trading, equal rights movements for women and\nblacks, segregation and desegregation and a pretty well rounded clear\nview of america through history. but we raised the flag respectfully\nevery morning and proudly, said the pledge of allegiance, and sang the\nstar spangled banner too! i think our generation learned a more\nbalanced view of american history than my kids have learned over the\nlast few decades. discussions with my kids were always good, but a\nstruggle. the conversations were usually ignited by a sense of\nindignant injustice that seemed aimed at unraveling american\npatriotism in the hearts of my kids. the information my kids learned\nwas undeniably infused with a biased unbalanced excitement concerning\nmistakes made as our country established, corrected, and evolved.\ntheir history education seems incomplete and unbalanced, and has less\nand less focus on content about the good things our country has done,\nand an exaggerated focus on the bad. in the recent political and\neducational environment, there seems to be a war within us, and in our\nclassrooms, against true american pride. an agenda to discredit and\ndevalue america through the eyes of our own kids. instead of teaching\nour kids to honor the lives sacrificed, american values, and our deeds\nof our generosity, and pride in our influence abroad and in actions we\nhave taken to protect and defend human lives and freedoms everywhere.\nour children come home with an indignant excitement about our\nwrinkles, which they can easily emotioally connect to, recall and\nrecant. but passion and excitement is completely missing for our\ncountry's valiant heroism and great humanitarian deeds. these\nqualities are not attached to the same excitement. through history,\namerica helped others, and gave to many other countries during\nnumerous tragedies... from natural disasters, to threats of genocide.\nwe fought with, and also fought for, a better life for people in every\npart of the world. we maintained peace during times of unrest and\nfear, and repaired war torn areas, and gave a better life to many that\nare not our own. all these good deeds done usually without thanks, and\noften to our own detriment. in a little over 200 years, america became\nthe greatest superpower on earth, with the rest of the world measuring\nworld peace, health, and wealth according to what america does next.\namazing!! we have more freedom, equality, and tolerance here in\namerica than anywhere else in the world, and we share it freely. yet,\nwe are under the greatest scrutiny and highest critisims from other\ncountries, even countries we often helped. but now, add insult to\ninjury, we are teaching our own children those attitudes, attacking\namerica from within! tear us down, remove us, then live in the world\nwithout america. my guess, the world would become a very dark place if\nit weren't for us. its tragic about indians and other atrocities in\nthe fabric of our history. but america has nothing to be ashamed of.\nwe corrected atrocities within ourselves, and we also corrected\natrocities abroad. why? because we were designed to give inalienable\nrights to all. young america grew, we became strong and generous. with\nmany growing pains both good and bad. we grew up like a growing child\nand then in maturity we became a parent who guides and cares for all.\namerica added religious and cultural diversity, it spread out from\nocean to ocean. immigrants found a land to call their home. people\nfrom everywhere survived and also thrived. they looked for a better\nlife and found it. they found freedom and a fair way of life. they\nadded to our numbers, added to our crowded cities, and chased gold.\nthey built homes, farms, and communities, while resources they had\nbeen denied elsewhere were richly available here. we built up way more\nthan we ever tore down. the wrinkles in our fabric are beautiful lines\nof wisdom that graced the face of a free diverse nation. we should\nteach our children pride of who we have become in the short time just\nover 200 years. teach our children to embrace both the good and the\nbad. in balance, with pride, as strong and unified, with hope for the\nfuture. it was a long journey made in a short time. honoring our\namerican heritage honors those who paved the way through all the\nchanges and adversity we faced together as a young nation. not just\nthe pride of us living today in america. but honoring those whose\nbones our freedoms were built upon. american heros who opposed\ntierney, slavery, racial divisions, supression, inequality and more.\nmany sacraficed everything for the american life we take for granted,\nas we teach our children to devalue their heritage, kill those that\nprotect them, and then scream for more because america owes them. then\nwe wonder why are influence abroad is disgraced and our streets are\nless safe. teach our children american pride! in just one lifetime of\n100 years, we used the land we fought for to benefit many. we filled\nit with people from every nation and every tongue. most of whom would\nagree, america gave them opportunities and hope they never would have\nhad anywhere else, including all those who are here inadvertently\nthrough wrinkles and adversity, but then found a home as americans. in\na lifetime of 100 years, we ended slavery, took out unstable world\npowers. we ended atrocities and regimes like hitler and others that\nabused their power. we aided countries everywhere helping them through\ndevastaion of natural disaters. we built irrigations, aided in food\nsupplies, provided medical relief, ended major diseases, and more and\nmore and more. all in all we blessed the world by being us. we are\namerica.",

                " when using words, i'm concerned with communication. making up a\npersonal definition for a word that already has a general definition\nis not useful to the goal of communication. arguing the on semantic\ngrounds for a definition that is personal and contrary to the general\ndefinition is a waste of time. worse then that, it is detrimental not\nonly to communication, but also to persuasion. presenting a personal\ndefinition as part of a framework can make sense for words with a\nbroad interpretation. if your personal definition works for various\nuses of the word, all the better. but when there is common language at\nyour disposable that articulates the same meaning you intend to convey\nwith a personal definition, then your personal definition is a\nhindrance to your goals. with that, i will (re)post some definitions:\nfreedom is the ability to act on one's own judgement concerning one's\nself and one's property, absent coercion or constraint from other\nagents. now the definition for authority : right to give orders, make\ndecisions, and enforce obedience. now government : the mechanism by\nwhich a group of people regulate behavior within a group and determine\ncollective goals or actions. i have already argued that we limit\nfreedom all the time in social interactions. we give subtle and overt\nwarnings that are both verbal and non-verbal. these warnings are\ncoercive since when those warnings are not heeded, people sometimes\nfight about it. such fights happen all the time, though they are rare\nwhen compared to the times people heed to warning signals of others.\nof you doubt this explanation, consider the interactions of people on\nthe internet, where no coercion is enforceable. the above is the\nsubtle way in which we limit freedom. your defense of your property is\nan example of you limiting the freedom of the trespasser. did the\ntrespassers \"abuse\" freedom? sure. he acted on his own judgement\nconcerning himself, but he acted in a manner that interferes with your\nproperty. so you have the right to decide to order him out of your\nhouse, and to enforce his obedience. according to the above\ndefinitions, that's you exercising authority to limit his freedom. if\nyou accept that you have the right to kick out the trespasser, then\nyou accept that freedom is not an inherent good (it can be abused),\nand authority is not an inherent evil (you have the authority to\nremove his freedom to trespass). there are other examples of someone\nhaving the authority to restrict the freedom of another: -if a person\nwith dementia insists on going for a walk on a cold winters night\nwithout proper clothes, pretty much anyone with the means has the\nright to restrict the dementia patients freedom and keep them in a\nwarm environment. -if a person has already had too much heroin and\nthey are ready to inject another full syringe, but this one is the\ngood stuff with fentanyl, you have the right to take that syringe,\nlimiting.their freedom in the process. -if a person is in the midst of\nan emotional crisis and they are actively attempting suicide, it's\nright to stop them long enough for them to come through the crisis and\nget the help they need. it's right, and it restricts their freedom.\nthe above examples infringe on the rights of people to harm themselves\nin very different ways. self-harm due to cognitive deterioration, due\nto addiction (accidentally seeking death), and due to emotional\ncrisis. each situation has a time horizon that the individual involved\ncannot see. they want the freedom to act according to their own\njudgement now, but later they are likely to seem that judgement\ndifferently. you would be right to stop them. their freedom doesn't\nhave inherent value, their life does. human freedom has an incredibly\nhigh value, but that's because we need it, as animals of reason, to\nlive and to thrive. the life has primacy. just as you have the\nauthority to hinder the freedom of the freedom-abuser, a government\nhas the authority to hinder the freedom of the freedom-abuser. by\nwhich i mean that people organizing a mechanism by which to regulate\nbehavior are right to regulate freedom-abusers. as i argued above,\npeople regulate the behavior of others all the time. it's a natural\nconsequence of interaction. the ways in which people regulate behavior\nare as numerous as individuals and circumstances. but some limited\ncircumstances involve so called freedom-abusers. people feel\nvictimized when one such interaction occurs. i'll call those true\ncrimes. when a true crime occurs, each of us respond in singularly\nunique ways. that's actually a problem. true crimes are highly\nemotional things. hence, vigilantism is a highly emotional thing. as\nsuch it is very often incorrect and imprecise in it's response. people\norganizing a mechanism by which to regulate the behavior of vigilantes\nreduces, though does not eliminate, the imprecision and inaccuracy of\njustice seekers. i said earlier that due process reduces the injustice\nof false positives which vigilantes are prone to and you only\nresponded that it's doubtful. that's an irrational doubt. due process\nhas laws (yes laws) requiring that standards of evidence be met before\na suspect can be prosecuted. there are no such standards in your\nanarchy. such laws in the us start from a presumption of innocence,\nputting the onus of proof on the one seeking justice. as a result,\nguilty parties often walk free. they can later capitalize on books\nthat outline their guilt. that's not quite justice, but it's better\nthan each individual presuming the guilt of the person they are really\nreally sure did the deed and then going and taking their vengeance as\nthey see fit, then failing every time the actually guilty party has\nthe muscle for it. due process is necessarily a system of laws. it\ncannot exist absent government. it cannot exist in your anarchy.\nprivate resolution requires voluntary parties. but true criminals,\nyour abusers of freedom, are not interested in resolution. you had to\nforce the trespasser to leave, of not with threat, then with force.\nand you had the right to order him to leave and enforce his obedience.\nthat's authority. most of the particulars of your last posts i did not\nrespond to. they were repetitive on both our accounts. if there's some\nquestion that actually has gone unaddressed ask it in a post\nresponding to this one."

                " the end result of a man being sexually abused and the end result of a\nchild being sexually abused are are the same to you? my argument was\nprimarily against the purported differences between men and women, as\nthat is the original subject matter of the debate which was gender\nviolence and not sexual abuse. i think there is more ground to argue\nthat the physical and psychological damage of abuse towards a child\nwould be different than for adults, but that is a matter of age\ndifference rather than gender. suggesting you're familiar with much\nresearch ... account for the desensitization to physicality that men\nendure ... prefer that men and women are identically physically\ninclined?... very different outcomes in terms of physical abuse i have\nabsolutely no idea what you are trying to say here. what do you mean\nby \"desensitization to physicality\"? i do not see what physical\ninclinations have to do with the matter either. #semantic-confusion\n\"general tendency to value human life more highly than animal life\" -\nthat was exactly my point when calling for change... if the degree of\npunishment is proportionate to the value we place upon a life, then\nyou are arguing that we should value the life and well-being of women\nmore than that of men. i don't understand the connection you're\ndrawing given that these aren't alternatives but 2 separate dynamics\naltogether. my point was that we do not find violence against animals\nto be as heinous as violence against a human being because of the\ndifference in physical strength but because of the value we view each\nas having. if someone abused a tiger (arguably the more powerful\ncreature) it would still be considered less heinous than if they\nabused a human being. self-species preference; nothing to do with\nstrength. i feel a misunderstanding occurred, i was commenting on your\nstatement that only 2 categories need to be addressed. potential for\nrecidivism (whatever the gender) must be considered. potential harm to\nthemselves can also be a factor in punishment. ah, i see now. other\nthings do factor into consideration, but in that comment i was\nharkening back to the debate topic which sought a definition of a hate\ncrime. definitionally the factors that matter are motive and\naction/harm; pragmatically other factors could be considered in\ndrafting law. i think this was a confusion stemming from having a\nsomewhat different debate under the umbrella of another debate... ...\nserial killer ... reliant upon the individual in question and any\nsocietal traits of relevance ... and psychological differences between\nwo/men/children i think you misunderstood my point. once a person is\nin a position of power that enables them to abuse another person they\nare in that position of power, regardless of what social or personal\nforces enabled them to obtain that position. men may be more likely to\nfind themselves in that position, but there is no reason to think that\nwhen a woman does she would harm her victim any less. you mention\npsychological differences between wo/men/children in regards to rape\nand abuse, however i was a little unclear as to what you were saying\nexactly. could you clarify? i think you are right about age insofar as\nthe effects would be different. i admittedly, however, have not done\nas much research on the psychological effects (duration, severity,\netc.) of rape based upon gender. my understanding of psychology though\nis that responses tend to be very individualized and i know of men and\nwomen who have been abused and have exhibited similar\nphysical/psychological injuries as a result. if you could direct me to\nany research to the contrary i might be more persuaded to your side.\n... you both are physically abused severely and hospitalized. you\nwould feel your sister didn't suffer more than you?... what about a 6\nyear old younger brother (or son of yours), if the wounds would be\nidentical, you would not think of his trauma more than your own? the\nfirst scenario is not as neat an example for me as might appear; i am\ntransgender so i walk the line of both genders a bit. what i can say\nis that if i had a sibling of either sex who was physically abused the\nsame as i was i would view their immediate suffering as equal to mine.\nhow we respond psychologically i would consider to be more a\nconsequence of a confluence of factors rather than primarily or solely\ndue to our respective sex/gender. regarding age, i think i have\nclarified my stance on that matter. irrelevant given your own point\nwhat should be considered was the actual motive and harm inflicted.\nwe're assuming identical physical trauma as per your outline. that was\nnot quite my point. what i was getting at is that if two individuals\neach suffer the same injury (e.g. a broken arm) it is the same injury\n(e.g. still a broken arm). this is not a statement that all cases of\nabuse have the same degree of physical trauma. my point still stands:\nthere are men who have physically suffered greater injury than some\nwomen. we aren't examining actual cases so this debate remains purely\nhypothetical.... perhaps i misunderstood your argument then about the\nhypothetical... i thought you were saying that because my points were\nbased upon the hypothetical they could not account for variables. i\nthink this was connected to some earlier confusion over the\ncategories... more so than the damage inflicted? after all my initial\npoint was that the damage is compounded in cases of men assaulting\nwomen/animals/children given the extra trauma that they are completely\nhelpless. men (however meek) still have more of a fighting chance. i\nthink that hate motivated crimes should incur additional punishment.\nregarding the damage inflicted, i think there is room within the law\nfor the amount of damage done to be considered. there are different\ndegrees of assault and battery that already account for variability in\ndamage done. these are assessed based upon actual damage rather than\nupon presumed vulnerability and outcomes. i think it is flawed to\nstate that women cannot inflict as much injury upon a man as a man can\nupon a woman, even if it is less likely. your argument hinges upon\nhighly gendered ideas of vulnerability that do not always hold true.\nalso, as i have said before once one has a position of power over\nanother person (psychological and/or physical) then they can inflict\nwhat damage they will. part of abuse is that it generally does have\nthe psychological component, and there are men who will not fight back\nor may not be able to. why not let the damage be accounted for within\nthe pre-existing degree of damage system rather than assuming what\nthat damage will be? i don't disagree if you agree with me that\nviolently beating a child is worse than violently beating an adult (i\nreally dislike this topic at the moment...). i do agree, both that\nchild abuse is worse and that the topic is rather unpleasant.\nirrelevant since i was initially calling for change from the general\npractice, you're stating the obvious. valid point, consider mine\nconceded on that ground. i do need to demonstrate preferability rather\nthan assert tradition. a man can most likely at least flee, a woman\ncan be very easily subdued and prevented from fleeing violence in most\ncircumstances. as a final note (and at least somewhat touching on my\ninitial point [i feel you missed it]), a man that knows he has control\ndue to his strength and still assaulting a woman is far more unsound\n(based on motive [cruelty]) than a woman doing the same to a man.\nagain, i think i have tried to address this by arguing that the\nsituations are not so cut and dry as you make them seem. a man trapped\nin an abusive relationship is not necessarily more likely to flee as\nthe psychological effects and manipulations are the same, regardless\nof who is exercising them. further, why would a man repeating abuse be\nmore unsound than a woman doing so? they both abuse an imbalance of\npower over their partner. additionally, in your earlier post you\nmentioned man on man violence and seemed to think that should have a\nreduced sentence as well. i am curious to know how that factors into\nyour considerations, seeing as the safe presumption is that the\nabusive partner has greater strength and power in the relationship...\ni have more to say but i'll stop here likewise. i also have to mention\n, you make a more convincing argument on rebuttal than in the original\npost; consider it safe to say that i think more of the idea than i did\nbefore."

form of more prisoners for\nhuman labor. private prisons thrive on this. cops aren't allowed to\njust follow orders. when an illegal order is followed, they get sued\nand fired and sometimes

class. anyone can become a politician and the claim\nis through the actions and operations of these people. do you mean the\nprocess of legislation? enforcement? judicial operations? as for\n\"ruling

of\nmy home and family, or myself. you are limiting a trespassers freedom\nwith barriers and, if that barrier is breached, you are using violence\nor the threat of violence to remove them (coercion). you are claiming\nthe right to do so. when you explain that it is your right to do so,\nyou aren't negating the fact that this is what you're doing. it is\nabsolutely different. did you read what i said? if the act does no\nharm to others, then, it is a right action. that's not true. an action\ncan cause no harm to others and still be wrong. i described nothing\nabout the trespasser that implies harm to you or your family. the\nperson is merely where you don't want them to be. how are you acting\ndifferent from government? as i pointed out above they tell me and\neveryone else how to live their lives, what they can or cannot do with\ntheir bodies, etc. you tell the trespasser what he cannot do, then you\nphysically enforce it if they disobey. the government has a law that\nsays they will punish you for assaulting someone. they will punish you\nis a predetermined way in accordance with predetermined rules and only\nafter you're granted due process. but to you, this is out of bounds.\nit's far better than your alternative. i have a right to protect my\nhome , family, and myself from harm. that is, it is a right action,\nthat does no harm to anyone else in doing so. you're claiming that\nright. but you perceive harm in a trespasser where the trespasser\nperceived no harm. are you really going to keep this stranger from\nfinishing his 6 pack on your couch? will you initiate violence against\nhim to see home off your property? this is the same as anyone has the\nright to do. it is not what i call a wrongful act, it is the truth. an\nact that causes harm to another sentient being is a wrongful act. do\nyou really not see how protecting yourself could harm a person? when\nyou punch a person to keep them from continuing to punch you, is their\nbroken nose not harmful to them? i am not opposed to organization. i\nstand against \"authority\" or the \"right to rule over others\", when no\nsuch right, in fact exists. where are these previously agreed upon\nrules of conduct? and who came up with them? what are they? you don't\nstand against your right to rule against trespasser in your house.\nlaws are the previously agreed on rules. legislators came up with\nthem. the vast cast majority of them concern the protection of people\nand property. here is reference to a small area in italy that held\ntheir independence from 1440 to 1826:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nrepublic ofcospaia this is probably your best bet. a small commune of\nlike minded people can accomplish all kinds of things that a larger\nsociety cannot. communism has functioned to varying degrees in\ncommunes. that doesn't make it a good model for society. which is why\nmy challenge was to present a large integrated society. in cospaia,\nthey relied on a \"council of elders and heads of families\" which\n\"decided with whom the members of the families would associate\npersonally and in business\". they didn't use threat of violence, but\nfamily pressure. i saw the godfather, but other then that i don't know\nwhat \"family pressure\" looks like in italy. anyway, good for them.\nproviding a commodity that your larger neighbors want, but is banned\nis a nice way to stay in business when you're too small to stave off\nmilitary invasion. you discounted zomia, and it does not say anything\nabout \"violent enforcement of values\" which is what the state does.\nzomia has some cultures that limit the amount of wealth and power\nyou're allowed to display. some further reading on zomia shows that\nmost of what is out there comes from an author named james scott, who\ncoined the name for the region. the area is composed of many different\ngroups of people living in small communities scattered across the\nregion. scott lumps them all together and puts every cultural artifact\nin terms of purposeful resistance to a state. he even claims their\nilliteracy is on purpose. if you want to know anything about the\npeople of this fabricated region of zomia, you have to look at each\nculture. a glance at hmong people in asia indicates that a woman may\nbe better off staying with her highly abusive husband because\ncommunity backlash against divorce would be worse for her. the karen\npeople aren't avoiding the state, they just keep losing when they try\nto form one. they occasionally have charismatic leaders rule over\nlarge enough groups to go fight the government and then they are\nsmashed to bits and scatter back to the hills. zomia could be\nanalogous to appalachia. where people don't like the government and\nhandle things themselves. where literacy is low and substance abuse\nand violence are high. some cultures in zomia probably have their own\nhatfields and mccoys. well now, my first property that i own is my\nbody. so, i guess, by your logic, my very existence restricts other's\nfreedom. there is a distinct difference between you and things. you\nare you. you own things. a person can infringe on your property rights\nwithout you even being present. this is not so with your person. as\nsuch, your ownership of yourself is distinct from your ownership of\ninanimate property. for you to even claim ownership of inanimate\nproperty as you claim ownership of yourself requires commonly accepted\nrules. many (most?) supposedly anarchic societies disregard your\nconception of ownership of inanimate things. your rules about property\ndon't apply to them. if you attempt to make them apply, you restrict\nfreedom. to those who disregard inanimate property rights, the\ntrespasser has the right to physically defend himself against your\nviolent aggression when you attempt to remove him from your couch. i\nsay \"capitalism\" can actually thrive when freedom is maximized. the\nbest way for that to occur is under voluntary conditions. this negates\nthe state. you say it, but it's not unsupportable. do you know what\ncheckers is without ground rules? cardboard and rubbish. there is no\ngame. government provides the rules of trade for capitalism. rules\naren't rules if they are not enforceable. rules are inconsistent and\nunpredictable if they are enforced by each person in each instance as\neach feels it should be at the time. laws make rules consistent and\npredictable. laws create an objective standard, rather than the pure\nsubjectivism of \"anarcho-capitalism\". i didn't say it would. but it\nwould reduce it down to a much lesser degree than what we have now,\nwith government. a baseless assertion. as nation states have grown in\ncomplexity and efficiency of enforcement, violence between individuals\nand groups has plummeted. archeological research shows that pre-modern\nlife, where people lives in small tribes, was exceedingly violent.\nlife was too often nasty, brutish and short. and the trespasser is not\ninnocent if he is trespassing or trying to steal my property. i would\nbe stopping him from doing this. he initiated the use of force when he\ntrespassed and tried to steal my things or do harm to me or mine.\nyou're making up property rights to assert a right to rule over the so\ncalled trespasser. if all is actually anarchy, then\ud83c\udfb5 this land is your\nland, this land is my land\ud83c\udfb5. if you kick me out of the house and call\nit yours, you are initiating force, and i the trespasser am defending\nmyself. if anarchy is reality, then property rights are as meaningful\nas the fiat currency you used to acquire your supposed property. a\nfree voluntary stateless society does not mean volunteer. voluntary\ninteractions amongst each other, without anyone forcing others to do\ntheir bidding against their will. that's utopic. people do force\nthings on others. without a state, there is no due process to deal\nwith such people. so the minute someone does what people often do,\nvictimize another, you have no recourse but a completely subjective\nsense of retribution, possibly against the wrong person. so, what\nhappens when people start to withdraw support for the state of that\nlarge, complex society. is it going to force everyone stay under it's\nthumb? it depends on what you mean

manner that is a problem for you, and you are restricting\nhis freedom as a result. if freedom can be used for evil (it can),\nthen it is not inherently good. it should be upheld where it is good\nand restricted where it is not, such as when you restrict the freedom\nof a trespasser. except that the governments of this planet have\nbecome the biggest criminal gangs and do exactly what you describe.\nthe u.s. being one of the biggest. drugs should not be legalized, they\nshould be decriminalized. not the same thing. this is another\nunsupported argument that begs the question. you've also avoided my\nentire point about turf wars. i presented the irrational economic\nreasons, but bloody feuds arise for emotional reasons as well. a\ndisinterested third party with superior fire power suppresses such\nfeuds. so, is a grocery store a government? i mean there is no real\n\"authority\". there are leadership roles, but that is not the same as a\nruler. everyone in that vast and complex network is operating\nvoluntarily, of their own free-will. no one is forcing them to work\nthere. if an employee breaks the rules that govern the business, the\nowner or manager may dock pay, or force the employee to leave against\ntheir will. the employee is no longer free to stay. they are your\ntrespasser. when jurisdictions are small, some governments do the very\nsame thing with banishment from their society. large jurisdictions\ndeport some, but banishment isn't much of an option. temporary\nbanishment into a jail has filled that role. is it centralized\n\"authority\"? do these groups, no matter the size get to tell others\nwho want nothing to do with their group that they must adhere to their\n\"rules\" or else? yes. there's always an \"or else\". you tell the\ntrespasser to leave your house \"or else\". the grocery tells employees\nto do their job in this or that way \"or else\". social pressure carries\nwith it a host of implied \"or else\". this is what i talked about\nearlier. people coerce others and restrict freedom in a whole host of\nways. no, government, by the root meaning of the word means \"to\ncontrol mind\". or mind control. the \"ment\" in government is not\nderived from the latin \"mente\" or mind. it is derived from the latin\n\"mentum\" or instrument/medium. government is the mechanism or\ninstrument by which behavior is governed, as i said. this meaning of\n\"instrument/medium\" applies to other \"ment\" words such as\nestablishment, management, compartment, etc. again the etymology is\nfrom \"mentum\", not \"mente\". but i have not said that there would be no\nconflict. what i describe is certainly not that. there will always be\nconflicts. the trick is to find ways to resolve them. this is why i\nsaid that even your conflicts are resolved through inexplicable\nagreement. most of the time people can work through disagreements.\nthis is because there is some larger principal that is agreed on. some\ncommon value appealed to by both. less commonly, though still\nprevalent, is the situation where conflicts cannot be resolved through\ncommon value. the only outcome here is force (through coercion or\nbarrier). either one party will be forced to leave without their value\nbeing achieved, or they will force the acquisition of their value from\nthe opposing party. so, did you ever read utopia? and you say that as\nif we should not try for it. i am not interested in the kind of\nsociety thomas more presented. likely neither are you. but we have to\nlive around each other. or else what? we do not have to live around\nothers. there are still empty places an unsociable person can choose\nto go. but if we choose to live around each other, we are going to be\nsubjected to consequences. others will always present soft and hard\nforms of limitations on freedom. soft forms are encountered all the\ntime with human interaction. hard forms are laws, and they aren't\ngoing anywhere either.",
                " i was deep into hinduism, americanized. it is a strong deception. i\nwas deep into it for a several years in late teens to early twenties.\nthe spirits, guides, whatever, the experiences, they are all\ndeceptions fed to minds eager to believe lies. but your supposed\nvisions of god and supposed interactions with the christian god are\ntotally legit? do you not see the hypocrisy? also just know that they\nway you feel toward hinduism right now is the way i feel toward your\nreligion. hence why you just spouting religious rhetoric toward me\nmeans nothing. if you really believe in reincarnation and hinduism,\nwhich is common for dope heads because the drugs help open the mind's\ndoor for the deceptions, you are making a fatal mistake and will wake\nup in hell if you don't repent and believe on the lord jesus christ. i\nquite obviously dont. it was quite clearly sarcasm and satire to\nreveal to you that the exact same things you say to me can be said for\nany religion. im sure me telling you that you are doomed from a hindu\npoint of view did not persuade you at all. thats exactly how i feel\nwhen you just spout doom speech and hell fire toward me. it means\nabsolutely nothing to me. god is a person, to you. to me he is an\nimaginary character his name is spelled \"god, or \"jesus christ\", or\nthe holy spirit\", or \"the king of kings, and lord of lords\", or the\nword of god, jesus\". when you call him \"god\", it's an insult for which\nhe holds you guilty. spelling his name with lowercase letters is an\ninsult of which im guilty of a crime? how freaking insecure is your\npetty god? does it not concern you that the all powerful almighty\ncreator of the universe feels the need to make one small species of\nmonkeys on some planet spell his name a certain way? is he really that\nshallow? but it doesnt concern me because, again, to me he does not\nexist. so i really dont care about offending a figment of some group's\ncollective imagination. you are going against your creator and trying\nto replace him with yourself, making yourself equally divine if you\nreally believe in hinduism...which i doubt. your doubts are correct.\nbut a hindu monk can easily turn around and say you are trying to\nreplace krishna and brahman with yourself when you worship the false\ngod of the bible. who is correct? who should i believe? you say god\nexists and the bible is true, he says krishna exists and the bag va\ngita is true. neither of you have offered any evidence or reason to\nbelieve your respective claims. so who do i go with? because either\nway im just blindly following you or the monk. what can you show me to\nconvince me that you are at the very least more correct than the monk?\nas deep as i was into it, i never really believed it's promises of\nattaining \"enlightenment\". and as deep as i was into christianity when\ni was younger i never really believed is you need to get saved, prove\nit but even with your wonderful management of language without\nresorting to profanities, i weary of people insulting god by calling\nhim \"god\" which would be something less than the living god who\ncreated all things then you are weary of literally the entire world\npopulation because nobody is nitpicky about spelling it with a capital\ng. and for me to spell it the way you do is to give credibility to\nyour worldview which i will not do because youve given me no reason to\nand are, for the most part, holding out on any type of conversation in\nwhich would could demonstrate such a reason. you can manage the \"god\"\nfake divinity of hinduism, you can argue against all gods as they are\nbut idols, but there is no counsel, nor understanding, nor wisdom\nagainst the lord god almighty, think of what you just said here. i can\nargue against all gods except your god. but again i ask you why should\ni not argue against your god? what makes your god any different than\naaaaaalllll the other gods out there? and have you given me any\nevidence no reason to believe your god is any more real or safe from\ncriticism than all the others? tthat's why in all arguments against\ngod he must be reduced to less than who he is in order for the anti-\nchrist spirited lost mind to believe he has the right to exist outside\nof hell as a sinner. its not that he must be reduced to that its that\nhe already is that. you just think that hes more than what he clearly\nis: just one god of many thousands of gods of thousands of other\nreligions that are all equally baseless and unfounded. so why dont you\ndemonstrate why he isnt that instead of just claiming that he is?\nanyone can claim anything but you only convince people of your side of\nthe argument by giving them a reason to believe your god is more than\njust an imaginary character."

                " the more it gets involved in services that had been or are provided\nby the private sector the worse that market gets. that depends. while\nmany things are better left to the market, that market exists within a\nlarger framework provided by government. the market cannot itself\nprovide that framework because that framework necessarily relies on a\nmonopoly on the initiation of force independent of market forces such\nas profit. the government does things it shouldn't. it does not follow\nfrom that fact that the government shouldn't do anything. no it is\nnot. no one should have a monopoly on these things...so, the truth is\nthat it is a monopoly on violence. something no one has a right to do\nto anyone else. that's not true. and if my family is killed, i have\nthe right to seek justice with the means i have available. if that\nmeans i go after the killer myself, then, i will do so. the person you\nbelieve is the killer has a right to due process. that process is\nnecessarily a legal process. that's why you don't have the right to\ntake it upon yourself. if there's no government, then there's no\npossibility for due process. in that case, you and anyone else can\nseek retribution against whomever you believe is guilty for whatever\nreason. and we would all be much worse off. and you are calling it a\nlegal institution, yet it is private. so, what do you mean when you\nsay \"legal institution\"? is it private, public, or do you see no\ndifference? that's my mistake. they are building an institution where\nlegal institutions are weak. of there were no legal institutions,\npeople would create them. no, the cop follows orders. one definition\nof profit is a valuable return, not necessarily money. it could\nsomething akin to human resources in the form of more prisoners for\nhuman labor. private prisons thrive on this. cops aren't allowed to\njust follow orders. when an illegal order is followed, they get sued\nand fired and sometimes imprisoned. cops follows laws and policies.\norders must be within law and policy for a cop to claim they were\njustified in acting on the order. politicians, for example, would be\nconsidered ruling class. anyone can become a politician and the claim\nis through the actions and operations of these people. do you mean the\nprocess of legislation? enforcement? judicial operations? as for\n\"ruling over other's ability to enter my property\" i have covered this\nalready. i am not ruling over anyone. claiming such a right is the\nsame as enslaving someone. i have not done this with the protection of\nmy home and family, or myself. you are limiting a trespassers freedom\nwith barriers and, if that barrier is breached, you are using violence\nor the threat of violence to remove them (coercion). you are claiming\nthe right to do so. when you explain that it is your right to do so,\nyou aren't negating the fact that this is what you're doing. it is\nabsolutely different. did you read what i said? if the act does no\nharm to others, then, it is a right action. that's not true. an action\ncan cause no harm to others and still be wrong. i described nothing\nabout the trespasser that implies harm to you or your family. the\nperson is merely where you don't want them to be. how are you acting\ndifferent from government? as i pointed out above they tell me and\neveryone else how to live their lives, what they can or cannot do with\ntheir bodies, etc. you tell the trespasser what he cannot do, then you\nphysically enforce it if they disobey. the government has a law that\nsays they will punish you for assaulting someone. they will punish you\nis a predetermined way in accordance with predetermined rules and only\nafter you're granted due process. but to you, this is out of bounds.\nit's far better than your alternative. i have a right to protect my\nhome , family, and myself from harm. that is, it is a right action,\nthat does no harm to anyone else in doing so. you're claiming that\nright. but you perceive harm in a trespasser where the trespasser\nperceived no harm. are you really going to keep this stranger from\nfinishing his 6 pack on your couch? will you initiate violence against\nhim to see home off your property? this is the same as anyone has the\nright to do. it is not what i call a wrongful act, it is the truth. an\nact that causes harm to another sentient being is a wrongful act. do\nyou really not see how protecting yourself could harm a person? when\nyou punch a person to keep them from continuing to punch you, is their\nbroken nose not harmful to them? i am not opposed to organization. i\nstand against \"authority\" or the \"right to rule over others\", when no\nsuch right, in fact exists. where are these previously agreed upon\nrules of conduct? and who came up with them? what are they? you don't\nstand against your right to rule against trespasser in your house.\nlaws are the previously agreed on rules. legislators came up with\nthem. the vast cast majority of them concern the protection of people\nand property. here is reference to a small area in italy that held\ntheir independence from 1440 to 1826:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nrepublic ofcospaia this is probably your best bet. a small commune of\nlike minded people can accomplish all kinds of things that a larger\nsociety cannot. communism has functioned to varying degrees in\ncommunes. that doesn't make it a good model for society. which is why\nmy challenge was to present a large integrated society. in cospaia,\nthey relied on a \"council of elders and heads of families\" which\n\"decided with whom the members of the families would associate\npersonally and in business\". they didn't use threat of violence, but\nfamily pressure. i saw the godfather, but other then that i don't know\nwhat \"family pressure\" looks like in italy. anyway, good for them.\nproviding a commodity that your larger neighbors want, but is banned\nis a nice way to stay in business when you're too small to stave off\nmilitary invasion. you discounted zomia, and it does not say anything\nabout \"violent enforcement of values\" which is what the state does.\nzomia has some cultures that limit the amount of wealth and power\nyou're allowed to display. some further reading on zomia shows that\nmost of what is out there comes from an author named james scott, who\ncoined the name for the region. the area is composed of many different\ngroups of people living in small communities scattered across the\nregion. scott lumps them all together and puts every cultural artifact\nin terms of purposeful resistance to a state. he even claims their\nilliteracy is on purpose. if you want to know anything about the\npeople of this fabricated region of zomia, you have to look at each\nculture. a glance at hmong people in asia indicates that a woman may\nbe better off staying with her highly abusive husband because\ncommunity backlash against divorce would be worse for her. the karen\npeople aren't avoiding the state, they just keep losing when they try\nto form one. they occasionally have charismatic leaders rule over\nlarge enough groups to go fight the government and then they are\nsmashed to bits and scatter back to the hills. zomia could be\nanalogous to appalachia. where people don't like the government and\nhandle things themselves. where literacy is low and substance abuse\nand violence are high. some cultures in zomia probably have their own\nhatfields and mccoys. well now, my first property that i own is my\nbody. so, i guess, by your logic, my very existence restricts other's\nfreedom. there is a distinct difference between you and things. you\nare you. you own things. a person can infringe on your property rights\nwithout you even being present. this is not so with your person. as\nsuch, your ownership of yourself is distinct from your ownership of\ninanimate property. for you to even claim ownership of inanimate\nproperty as you claim ownership of yourself requires commonly accepted\nrules. many (most?) supposedly anarchic societies disregard your\nconception of ownership of inanimate things. your rules about property\ndon't apply to them. if you attempt to make them apply, you restrict\nfreedom. to those who disregard inanimate property rights, the\ntrespasser has the right to physically defend himself against your\nviolent aggression when you attempt to remove him from your couch. i\nsay \"capitalism\" can actually thrive when freedom is maximized. the\nbest way for that to occur is under voluntary conditions. this negates\nthe state. you say it, but it's not unsupportable. do you know what\ncheckers is without ground rules? cardboard and rubbish. there is no\ngame. government provides the rules of trade for capitalism. rules\naren't rules if they are not enforceable. rules are inconsistent and\nunpredictable if they are enforced by each person in each instance as\neach feels it should be at the time. laws make rules consistent and\npredictable. laws create an objective standard, rather than the pure\nsubjectivism of \"anarcho-capitalism\". i didn't say it would. but it\nwould reduce it down to a much lesser degree than what we have now,\nwith government. a baseless assertion. as nation states have grown in\ncomplexity and efficiency of enforcement, violence between individuals\nand groups has plummeted. archeological research shows that pre-modern\nlife, where people lives in small tribes, was exceedingly violent.\nlife was too often nasty, brutish and short. and the trespasser is not\ninnocent if he is trespassing or trying to steal my property. i would\nbe stopping him from doing this. he initiated the use of force when he\ntrespassed and tried to steal my things or do harm to me or mine.\nyou're making up property rights to assert a right to rule over the so\ncalled trespasser. if all is actually anarchy, then\ud83c\udfb5 this land is your\nland, this land is my land\ud83c\udfb5. if you kick me out of the house and call\nit yours, you are initiating force, and i the trespasser am defending\nmyself. if anarchy is reality, then property rights are as meaningful\nas the fiat currency you used to acquire your supposed property. a\nfree voluntary stateless society does not mean volunteer. voluntary\ninteractions amongst each other, without anyone forcing others to do\ntheir bidding against their will. that's utopic. people do force\nthings on others. without a state, there is no due process to deal\nwith such people. so the minute someone does what people often do,\nvictimize another, you have no recourse but a completely subjective\nsense of retribution, possibly against the wrong person. so, what\nhappens when people start to withdraw support for the state of that\nlarge, complex society. is it going to force everyone stay under it's\nthumb? it depends on what you mean by withdrawal. people take off to\nalaska, siberia, or even rural colorado. no one care. others choose to\nset up a criminal enterprise for not only elicit substances, but human\ntrafficking (prostitution), dog fighting, murder for hire, and a host\nof other harmless endeavors deemed \"wrong\" by the government. those\nkinds of dissenters are hunted and put in cages. most people are

                " the more it gets involved in services that had been or are provided\nby the private sector the worse that market gets. that depends. while\nmany things are better left to the market, that market exists within a\nlarger framework provided by government. the market cannot itself\nprovide that framework because that framework necessarily relies on a\nmonopoly on the initiation of force independent of market forces such\nas profit. the government does things it shouldn't. it does not follow\nfrom that fact that the government shouldn't do anything. no it is\nnot. no one should have a monopoly on these things...so, the truth is\nthat it is a monopoly on violence. something no one has a right to do\nto anyone else. that's not true. and if my family is killed, i have\nthe right to seek justice with the means i have available. if that\nmeans i go after the killer myself, then, i will do so. the person you\nbelieve is the killer has a right to due process. that process is\nnecessarily a legal process. that's why you don't have the right to\ntake it upon yourself. if there's no government, then there's no\npossibility for due process. in that case, you and anyone else can\nseek retribution against whomever you believe is guilty for whatever\nreason. and we would all be much worse off. and you are calling it a\nlegal institution, yet it is private. so, what do you mean when you\nsay \"legal institution\"? is it private, public, or do you see no\ndifference? that's my mistake. they are building an institution where\nlegal institutions are weak. of there were no legal institutions,\npeople would create them. no, the cop follows orders. one definition\nof profit is a valuable return, not necessarily money. it could\nsomething akin to human resources in the form of more prisoners for\nhuman labor. private prisons thrive on this. cops aren't allowed to\njust follow orders. when an illegal order is followed, they get sued\nand fired and sometimes imprisoned. cops follows laws and policies.\norders must be within law and policy for a cop to claim they were\njustified in acting on the order. politicians, for example, would be\nconsidered ruling class. anyone can become a politician and the claim\nis through the actions and operations of these people. do you mean the\nprocess of legislation? enforcement? judicial operations? as for\n\"ruling over other's ability to enter my property\" i have covered this\nalready. i am not ruling over anyone. claiming such a right is the\nsame as enslaving someone. i have not done this with the protection of\nmy home and family, or myself. you are limiting a trespassers freedom\nwith barriers and, if that barrier is breached, you are using violence\nor the threat of violence to remove them (coercion). you are claiming\nthe right to do so. when you explain that it is your right to do so,\nyou aren't negating the fact that this is what you're doing. it is\nabsolutely different. did you read what i said? if the act does no\nharm to others, then, it is a right action. that's not true. an action\ncan cause no harm to others and still be wrong. i described nothing\nabout the trespasser that implies harm to you or your family. the\nperson is merely where you don't want them to be. how are you acting\ndifferent from government? as i pointed out above they tell me and\neveryone else how to live their lives, what they can or cannot do with\ntheir bodies, etc. you tell the trespasser what he cannot do, then you\nphysically enforce it if they disobey. the government has a law that\nsays they will punish you for assaulting someone. they will punish you\nis a predetermined way in accordance with predetermined rules and only\nafter you're granted due process. but to you, this is out of bounds.\nit's far better than your alternative. i have a right to protect my\nhome , family, and myself from harm. that is, it is a right action,\nthat does no harm to anyone else in doing so. you're claiming that\nright. but you perceive harm in a trespasser where the trespasser\nperceived no harm. are you really going to keep this stranger from\nfinishing his 6 pack on your couch? will you initiate violence against\nhim to see home off your property? this is the same as anyone has the\nright to do. it is not what i call a wrongful act, it is the truth. an\nact that causes harm to another sentient being is a wrongful act. do\nyou really not see how protecting yourself could harm a person? when\nyou punch a person to keep them from continuing to punch you, is their\nbroken nose not harmful to them? i am not opposed to organization. i\nstand against \"authority\" or the \"right to rule over others\", when no\nsuch right, in fact exists. where are these previously agreed upon\nrules of conduct? and who came up with them? what are they? you don't\nstand against your right to rule against trespasser in your house.\nlaws are the previously agreed on rules. legislators came up with\nthem. the vast cast majority of them concern the protection of people\nand property. here is reference to a small area in italy that held\ntheir independence from 1440 to 1826:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nrepublic ofcospaia this is probably your best bet. a small commune of\nlike minded people can accomplish all kinds of things that a larger\nsociety cannot. communism has functioned to varying degrees in\ncommunes. that doesn't make it a good model for society. which is why\nmy challenge was to present a large integrated society. in cospaia,\nthey relied on a \"council of elders and heads of families\" which\n\"decided with whom the members of the families would associate\npersonally and in business\". they didn't use threat of violence, but\nfamily pressure. i saw the godfather, but other then that i don't know\nwhat \"family pressure\" looks like in italy. anyway, good for them.\nproviding a commodity that your larger neighbors want, but is banned\nis a nice way to stay in business when you're too small to stave off\nmilitary invasion. you discounted zomia, and it does not say anything\nabout \"violent enforcement of values\" which is what the state does.\nzomia has some cultures that limit the amount of wealth and power\nyou're allowed to display. some further reading on zomia shows that\nmost of what is out there comes from an author named james scott, who\ncoined the name for the region. the area is composed of many different\ngroups of people living in small communities scattered across the\nregion. scott lumps them all together and puts every cultural artifact\nin terms of purposeful resistance to a state. he even claims their\nilliteracy is on purpose. if you want to know anything about the\npeople of this fabricated region of zomia, you have to look at each\nculture. a glance at hmong people in asia indicates that a woman may\nbe better off staying with her highly abusive husband because\ncommunity backlash against divorce would be worse for her. the karen\npeople aren't avoiding the state, they just keep losing when they try\nto form one. they occasionally have charismatic leaders rule over\nlarge enough groups to go fight the government and then they are\nsmashed to bits and scatter back to the hills. zomia could be\nanalogous to appalachia. where people don't like the government and\nhandle things themselves. where literacy is low and substance abuse\nand violence are high. some cultures in zomia probably have their own\nhatfields and mccoys. well now, my first property that i own is my\nbody. so, i guess, by your logic, my very existence restricts other's\nfreedom. there is a distinct difference between you and things. you\nare you. you own things. a person can infringe on your property rights\nwithout you even being present. this is not so with your person. as\nsuch, your ownership of yourself is distinct from your ownership of\ninanimate property. for you to even claim ownership of inanimate\nproperty as you claim ownership of yourself requires commonly accepted\nrules. many (most?) supposedly anarchic societies disregard your\nconception of ownership of inanimate things. your rules about property\ndon't apply to them. if you attempt to make them apply, you restrict\nfreedom. to those who disregard inanimate property rights, the\ntrespasser has the right to physically defend himself against your\nviolent aggression when you attempt to remove him from your couch. i\nsay \"capitalism\" can actually thrive when freedom is maximized. the\nbest way for that to occur is under voluntary conditions. this negates\nthe state. you say it, but it's not unsupportable. do you know what\ncheckers is without ground rules? cardboard and rubbish. there is no\ngame. government provides the rules of trade for capitalism. rules\naren't rules if they are not enforceable. rules are inconsistent and\nunpredictable if they are enforced by each person in each instance as\neach feels it should be at the time. laws make rules consistent and\npredictable. laws create an objective standard, rather than the pure\nsubjectivism of \"anarcho-capitalism\". i didn't say it would. but it\nwould reduce it down to a much lesser degree than what we have now,\nwith government. a baseless assertion. as nation states have grown in\ncomplexity and efficiency of enforcement, violence between individuals\nand groups has plummeted. archeological research shows that pre-modern\nlife, where people lives in small tribes, was exceedingly violent.\nlife was too often nasty, brutish and short. and the trespasser is not\ninnocent if he is trespassing or trying to steal my property. i would\nbe stopping him from doing this. he initiated the use of force when he\ntrespassed and tried to steal my things or do harm to me or mine.\nyou're making up property rights to assert a right to rule over the so\ncalled trespasser. if all is actually anarchy, then\ud83c\udfb5 this land is your\nland, this land is my land\ud83c\udfb5. if you kick me out of the house and call\nit yours, you are initiating force, and i the trespasser am defending\nmyself. if anarchy is reality, then property rights are as meaningful\nas the fiat currency you used to acquire your supposed property. a\nfree voluntary stateless society does not mean volunteer. voluntary\ninteractions amongst each other, without anyone forcing others to do\ntheir bidding against their will. that's utopic. people do force\nthings on others. without a state, there is no due process to deal\nwith such people. so the minute someone does what people often do,\nvictimize another, you have no recourse but a completely subjective\nsense of retribution, possibly against the wrong person. so, what\nhappens when people start to withdraw support for the state of that\nlarge, complex society. is it going to force everyone stay under it's\nthumb? it depends on what you mean by withdrawal. people take off to\nalaska, siberia, or even rural colorado. no one care. others choose to\nset up a criminal enterprise for not only elicit substances, but human\ntrafficking (prostitution), dog fighting, murder for hire, and a host\nof other harmless endeavors deemed \"wrong\" by the government. those\nkinds of dissenters are hunted and put in cages. most people are glad\nfor it. it is not necessary, no matter how large a given population\nis. people can and do work things out amongst themselves. we are\nindividuals, not a collective like a behive. we are not the borg.\npeople can and do work most things out amongst themselves in the us\ntoday. and other people victimize people. the violent criminal cannot\nbe addressed by folks working things out with each individual case.\nthey must be addressed through due process, which is necessarily\ngovernmental. the alternative is the mob and vigilantism. both of\nwhich require only the emotional impulses of the vengeance seekers.\nyeah, they should have obeyed authority er the law. those laws should\nnot be in place, to begin with. if there is no victim, there is no\ncrime. again, the point is that laws are predictable and fairly\nconsistent over time. even bad laws. but it is. there are mounds of\nlaws, regulations and such on the books. you need a license to do just\nabout anything anymore. and a license means \"permission given for what\nis illegal\". you mentioned the communist manifesto. if you take a look\nat it's ten planks, almost if not all of them have been established\nhere in the u.s. your argument, that there are so many laws that no\none knows when they are breaking one, requires that you are unaware of\nevidence of your assertion. by naming those laws that you don't like,\nyou admit that you are aware of them. it is true that there are a\nsubstantial number of regulations on business. too many. these\nregulations do not result in unforeseen criminal charges for private\ncitizens nor for most companies. that's because people know what the\nlaws are. which is my point. it is almost never the case that people\nare charged for ignorance of their own illegal activity. and one has\nto stretch to see most of the ten planks in the us. income tax does\nnot mean we are all marxists now. and if we were, we would be that\nmuch closer to the stateless end marx sought. i'm glad we aren't.\nthere are far more prohibitive laws on the books than there are to do\nwith evil acts or ones that do harm. most criminal law refers to\nproperty crime and violent crime. if you threw out all drug\nprohibitions today, you would leave most of our criminal laws in tact.\nif i am not mistaken, it was the obamacare act. it made it a\nrequirement to get health insurance or be penalized by the irs. trump\nmight have done a way with that part, but now biden is in there; it\nchanges with their whims. and if you don't get health insurance, you\npay at tax time. the only way they could make it constitutional was to\nmake it a tax. as much as that is bullshit, it's not a substantial\nchange. money at tax time is par for the course. people can and do\norganize and come up with a means to resolve such issues. \"political\nauthority\" or government will not do this, but will make matters\nworse. there is the free market and there is property rights in a free\nsociety, i.e. stateless one or no centralized political authority. the\nonly property rights in a stateless society are those that you can\nsecure with your own threat of violence. just like the trespasser in\nyour house. the existence of property rights negate absolute freedom.\nas i have explained, your enforcement of property rights limits the\nfreedom of another to use said property. political authority has\nhistorically made property disputes resolvable so efficiently and\npeacefully that we are now able to enjoy the large and complex modern\nsociety that no commune or stateless backwater can produce. that's why\npeople won't walk away from society. they are better off staying. but\nmorality must be recognized and adhered to, in order for freedom to be\nmaximized. anarchy reigns, regardless. when i say that \"no one has a\nright to rule over others\" that means that right does not exist.\nultimately, no has control over anybody, but themselves. and to try to\ntake that control from someone else is wrong, and flatout evil. yet\nthat's exactly what you do with the trespasser. calling your property\nnan extension of yourself does not actually make you and your property\nthe same thing. it merely makes your actions against the free movement\nof another seem justified to you. the trespasser can use your same\nposition to justify self-defense against you on property that he does\nnot believe nyoi can call your own. natural law doesn't. but man's\nlaws do. if you write down an explicit example of natural law, and\nthen write down the consequences for breaching it, you have created\nman's law. in fact, the only difference between natural law and man's\nlaw is the difference between laws you personally like and laws you\ndon't. furthermore, laws are fundamentally statements of consequences,\nnot merely dictates. what is an example of natural law? what is the\nconsequence for the crime you would list? is inanimate property\nownership a right under natural law when it necessarily restricts the\nfreedom of others? what is the consequence for breaching that right?\nsince government can be used for evil, you advocate it's elimination.\nbut freedom can be used for evil, so why argue for it's maximization?\nthe rest of what you describe, i would agree with except the last\npart. what they have done there is the miss use of freedom. it does\nnot show it to be inherently, not good. it is an attempt to abuse\nothers. that is not freedom. it is freedom. you just dislike it. if\nyou agree with my definition, then the trespasser is simply using\nfreedom in a manner that is a problem for you, and you are restricting\nhis freedom as a result. if freedom can be used for evil (it can),\nthen it is not inherently good. it should be upheld where it is good\nand restricted where it is not, such as when you restrict the freedom\nof a trespasser. except that the governments of this planet have\nbecome the biggest criminal gangs and do exactly what you describe.\nthe u.s. being one of the biggest. drugs should not be legalized, they\nshould be decriminalized. not the same thing. this is another\nunsupported argument that begs the question. you've also avoided my\nentire point about turf wars. i presented the irrational economic\nreasons, but bloody feuds arise for emotional reasons as well. a\ndisinterested third party with superior fire power suppresses such\nfeuds. so, is a grocery store a government? i mean there is no real\n\"authority\". there are leadership roles, but that is not the same as a\nruler. everyone in that vast and complex network is operating\nvoluntarily, of their own free-will. no one is forcing them to work\nthere. if an employee breaks the rules that govern the business, the\nowner or manager may dock pay, or force the employee to leave against\ntheir will. the employee is no longer free to stay. they are your\ntrespasser. when jurisdictions are small, some governments do the very\nsame thing with banishment from their society. large jurisdictions\ndeport some, but banishment isn't much of an option. temporary\nbanishment into a jail has filled that role. is it centralized\n\"authority\"? do these groups, no matter the size get to tell others\nwho want nothing to do with their group that they must adhere to their\n\"rules\" or else? yes. there's always an \"or else\". you tell the\ntrespasser to leave your house \"or else\". the grocery tells employees\nto do their job in this or that way \"or else\". social pressure carries\nwith it a host of implied \"or else\". this is what i talked about\nearlier. people coerce others and restrict freedom in a whole host of\nways. no, government, by the root meaning of the word means \"to\ncontrol mind\". or mind control. the \"ment\" in government is not\nderived from the latin \"mente\" or mind. it is derived from the latin\n\"mentum\" or instrument/medium. government is the mechanism or\ninstrument by which behavior is governed, as i said. this meaning of\n\"instrument/medium\" applies to other \"ment\" words such as\nestablishment, management, compartment, etc. again the etymology is\nfrom \"mentum\", not \"mente\". but i have not said that there would be no\nconflict. what i describe is certainly not that. there will always be\nconflicts. the trick is to find ways to resolve them. this is why i\nsaid that even your

                " law and religion! law should never make law against religion, and\nreligion should not be honored against law. that's a fucking\ncontradiction. if a law is honored over a religion it was made against\nthe religion. religions, most of them! believe gay sexuality is\nimmorality. still shouldn't be honored against the law. religion all\nof them, have beliefs surrounding sexuality. still shouldn't be\nhonored against the law. they most all, have sexual morality beliefs\nthat strictly hold to you guys aren't actually. that's a big problem i\nhave. the baker is only checking for one sexually immoral action.\nbeing gay isn't the only sexually immoral action you can take. if the\nbaker was actually looking at all sexual immorality we could have a\ndiscussion. but, no baker does, so nothing is being strictly held. and\nno deviation, no adultery. 1st of all it would be an invasion of\nprivacy! 2nd of all she has no idea how a 1st marriage fell apart. and\nshe has no right nor social comfort level discussing their sexuality\nwhen she is simply baking cakes. but a guy and a guy getting married\nis an apparent issue and its apparentluly immorality without prying or\nasking or anything. now if 1 gay guy came in and said i want steve and\nsue on a cake, and she has no idea, she probably wouldnt ask either\numless she was given a reason. like if the guy is talking about his\nboyfriend sue, or he was behaing in a way that indicated he was gay,\nshe may ask a basic question regarding wedding details. if details\nduring the cake order cause her to interpret sue as a man, them she\nhas a right to confirm its not going against her faith. she cant\nignore interpretting something she needs to question for processing\nthe order. but if the guy ordered with no indication, she mighy not\nhave a readon to ask. like if he ordered on line with basic\ninstructions steve an sue.but she has the right to ask if a question\nis raised within her conscience! they have no problems with adultery\ncakes. it would be inappropriate to discuss how many marriages, or why\nhe is not with wife. but if she knows him, and knows he was an\nadulterer she also may deny his cake! but a gay couple is visually\ndiscernable. the others she would have to invade privacy and be\ninappropriate to gather. and thats not right either! because, it would\nbe a law for 1 or a few that would be against the religious beliefs of\nthe many groups. no, it is because a married man is not being denied\nthe opportunity to get married. he is already married. he can't claim\nthat he has been denied the chance to be married. no his belief is\nmany wives, so to him he hs not met his belief of many wives. and also\ni am not saying the law cant gove the gay couple or even the mormon a\nlaw that allows practice of beliefs, i am saying it cant be a matter\nif discrimunation thereby forcing either of these beliefs on all\nothers! though in the case of mormons, many wives are married by force\ninto it, so id say the law should not grant for the rights of the\nwomen! the gay couple is consensual, a civil union marriage would be\npurely for the benefit of the gay couple. and should not be for the\nforce onto all others. so in that case a law of exception for the\nbenefit of 1 that has minimal to no impact on others, would compare\nto, some religious people do not believe in immunizations. depending\non public safety, a law of exception may exclude from immunizations. a\nbreak out in measles though may recind, for public safety. or may\nlimit their exception. like they can opt out of all but measles etc\nlaw when made, should be neutral. yep. good thing the new marriage law\nfixed that. if they said yes to many wives they would be forcing it.\nno, its forcing it against beliefs of all, the only fair law is\nexclusive, but not on all! so if gov gave exclusive to the gay couple.\nthe couple can enter the state marriage contract. and register with\nstate and federal for all benefits of marriage partnership! such as\nbuying a home in joint tenancy, or inheritace, survivorship, or\nmedical benefits. and community and churches participate by personal\nchoice, not force. which on a happy occassion, why would you want a\nphotographer there all day who clearly feels forced. wouldnt you\nchoose a photographer that is there under his own accord?? so couple\nis celebrating tying their union! go to a baker, 1 says \"i cant,\nreligious reason muslim, christian whatever,\" great no penalty, no\nhate crime, no throwing icing! baker didnt thow baking pans at them!\ncouple goes to another baker, and their glad to. great no one is hurt.\nwe all suffer unhappy moments in stores. we may leave bugged or\npissed, hapoens all the time! for a few minutes, or maybe it makes our\nwhole day lousy! but there are no scars. the baker saying \"i cant\" was\nupsetting, but not tragic! but her being dragged to court is tragic,\nher being fined is tragic, and her closing her business is\ndevastating! the gay couple being told \"i can't do it\" what is the\nlife altering damage here. its nothing less tha ambulamce chasing! why\ndo you think thats an acceptable match of damages? supreme court\nbreech of church and state. its damaging tk communities and divisive,\nand negative for gays also! law against all created a dynamic for\nbreaking a law that should only exist for the gay couples benefit, not\nto incriminate people for religious beliefs!! back to no to many\nwives: well, actually no not at all. the religion has requirements for\nyou to follow, not for everyone else to follow. if your neighbor bob\nhas 5 wives, it doesn't affect your religion at all. actually yes it\ndoes, because it is a conflict to society from caterers to realtors to\ntax accountants to financial planners. and employers providing\nbenefits. and as i mentioned before it is a crime against women, who\nfeel compelled by their pastors and other men, and the other women are\ncompelled to.enforce the will of these men. and then, if divorce\noccurs who gets what assets. so it is a matter of rights of women\npressured, and giving an exclusion for them is not necessarily denied\nbecause of all others, but if all others where considered, then it\nwould have to be exclusive. participation of others by choice, not\nforce. in utah, they have turned a blind eye. not making law of\nallowance, but till recently cohabitation was allowable, not\ncertification. meaning most townships have occupancy laws. like no\nmore than 3 adults unrelated living together. student housing\nexceptions are prome real estate because of these lawd! but in utah\ntill recently they did not disturb a man wife and 3 other adult women\nunrelated cohabitating. i think they recently have been addressing\nthat more strictly. so law is supposed to be made for law breakers.\nbut its not supposed to be made then create law breakers. ok, but no\nlaw was created. yes supreme court ruling - same sex marriage wasnt\nwritten as exclusive exception, which if it were it absolutely would\nhave been fine! because not forced on all, would allow for religious\nfreedom, still give the couple all benefits of marriage, and give the\ncommunity the choice individually for participation. and no one like\nthe baker would be sued, the couple could have a fun celebration with\npeople happy to be involved, churches wouldnt have to rewrite bylaws\nto protect themselves, and no one would be scrutinizwd for what they\nbelieve ot dont believe. everyone enjoys rights and freedoms without\nanyone being denied their rights and freedoms. and society is happy\nworking togethervand being a cimmunity that is healthy and vibrant,\nwith everyone happy, not this 1/2 miserable, and the other 1/2 causing\npain and this potential of loosing your livlihood for your faith!\nfreedom of religion should protect what you believe as long as you are\nnot trampling anothers rights. giving gays a law exclusive was\nacceptable for all. unless gays want to trample others rights. then\nthats a different conversatuon. then we are back to selfishness!"

im a christian, and i dont think tatoos are a\nsin. others may, its their freedom to do so! born again religions, may\nnot judge where or why a person has tattoos, and likely wouldn't judge\ntheir tattos. they may have a story to tell, let them! a church i\nstepped into several years back in philly while handing out food and\nblankets with my church group refused to let me use their bathroom\nbecause i am a woman and was wearing pants. yhey may believe\ndifferently and are strict about other things that other churches are\nnot strict with. and it should be ok to believe either way, and i\ncould care less about what they believe, thats their business, my\nbeliefs are my business! tolerance, live and let live. i have a belly\nring, and one of my favorite people in the world is my baby, youngest\ndaughter, because she is sweet. she has a guage earing, and has had\npurple to teal hair since she was in jr high. wawa and starbucks won't\nhire her, because visually she has an unnatural color hair. but, there\nare plenty of jobs that will. so she chooses to keep her crazy colors,\nand work where they dont have an issue with it! many churches dont\nthink certain vices are sin, like smoking or social drinking. there\nare varying degrees of doctrines. thats why religious freedom is so\nimportant!!!! many sects if christianity are evem loose on sexual\npreference, most i know are strict. but it is not up to people, or\ngovernment, or courts to scruitinize anyone's beliefs including gays\nwho have religious beliefs that are inclusive of sexual orientaton,\nunless a real crime has been commited. just like freedom of speech of\nevery degree is protected! both speech and religious freedom are\npersonal expression regarding what they think and believe about\neverything that matters to them! disabilities are not a choice and\nbeing black isnt a choice either, although honestly, america needs to\nhead in a different direction where all people regardless of race, all\nare equaly protected, and not especially protected! protected classes\nshould be represented of all groups of people and found in every race\nand culture! such as disabilities, and religions, ages, and gender. i'\nll explain: religion because it effects all races, genders, classes,\nand found in every walk of life. every religion from christian to\nmuslim to jews etc, and also religions that are permissive, and are\ninclusive of gay membership and leadership should have religious\nfreedom. does it mean we won' t bump into each other at times, but how\nabout we behave politely and say excuse me! or ok discussed agree to\ndisagree! isnt that what a \"progressive\" society is all about!\ndisabilities protected because they need to compete according to the\nabilities they do have. and people with disabilities are present in\nevery group. and age, because they have to compete against younger\ncandidates, and again age is a factor for every group so it is\nselective of none. and women, because they need to compete equally\nagainst men who have different strengths, and women need to be able to\ncompete according to their strengths, and not limited by the\nweaknesses they may present in a workplace, physically, or even\nregards to future pregnancies, birth, maternity leaves, sick kids, and\nother family responsibilities that could cause bias or expense of down\ntime or added health insurance costs. up till recently health\ninsurances have been higher because of reproduction. an example are\nthe nuns who recently fought cost of health insurance inclusive of\nreproductive ability. and they are abstinent, (except for some who\nchange their mind and take directions leading out of the vocation) the\nfollowing groups of classes are across the board represented in every\nsingle group of race and culture. so american 1st! america is multi\ncultural so every culture should be protected classes - american 1st,\nand white 2nd, italian 2nd, black 2nd, gay 2nd, married 2nd, single\n2nd, economic class 2nd. but in every american group of people, there\nare equally specific groups whovshould be protection from\ndiscrimination. and its reasonable, because it puts competing equal\nfor all in every group. but it can't be given above religious freedom\nof all, or its selective group breeching separation of church and\nstate because then it prohibits the free exercise of religion for all,\nexcept for 1 such as lgbt. sexual orientation should not be a\nprotected class. it's a lifestyle, and sexual choice. even if you\nbelieve it was genetic, every baby is born with the same option of\nchoice, and genetic or not can choose it. but in common every group\nhas: disabled, age, gender, and religion. we as a society should have\nmoved beyond the racial division to the next phase atleast 10 years\nago. not adding more divisions!! there will always be bullies, for\neveryone, in every group. reverse discrimination is just as much a\nproblem as discrimination!! the baker could even be an example of\nthis, she was signaled out in reverse discrimination, legally, for her\nbeliefs. yet not 1 case invoving muslims was brought forth even though\nthey believe the same. there is footage showing 3 muslim bakeries who\nalso would not make a cake against their own religious beliefs!\ndiscrimination for sexual orientation opens religions up for open\nhunting season as targets to be abused by anyone who is sexually\noriented protected. re: transgender bathroom laws: we were not likely\naware or able to notice transgenders in bathrooms. but creating laws,\nprotecting them in discriminations and allowing choice of bathrooms\nare also open hunting season by anyone who wants to exploit others,\nfor personal gain, political media attention, or both, and also for\npreditors. so if transgenders are really living like their identity,\nthen go in, close the door, and dont draw unneeded attention. and live\namd let live! if arrested, there is defense! you dont need a law for\nthat! bring your doctors report and it isnt an issue! maybe an\nexclusive allowance if identified could prevent problems instead of\ncreating them. nc didnt randomly make a law, they made it in response\nto extreme demands made by groups like lgbt! so be mad at them! the\nproblem is, special interest groups want to be special, superior,\nstand out, have special privelages, and allowances. they want to be\nable to control society, and discrimination laws are a license to\ncontrol and abuse others. they are only divisive, and cause unfairness\nto others resulting in further discrimination, and reverse\ndiscrimination! and this is the liberals play ground, the more\nproblems they create, the more it looks like you all need them! there\nwill always be hate crimes for everyone. fat, ugly, body shaming, gay,\nshort, black, white, spanish, asian etc. compete as americans, put\nthese divisive groups out! and we will be the america we intended to\nbe since 1776! religious freedom was and is inclusive of all. it is\nours by constitutional guarantee! society corrected many issues,\nspecial interest groups stop progress by extremes! now its time to\nmove past it all and simply be american. making some groups a\nprotected class, leaves others unprotected ex. the baker, florist, and\nthe marriage certificate clerk. all who should have had resposible\nsociety step in and protect them, and provide alternatives of other\nbusinesses, or signers. these exclusive special interest groups are\ndivisive. examples: making an excluse black statement, and forcing us\nto see you as black is counter productive. we dont want to \"have\" to\nlike you because you are black. we want to like you because you have\nintegrity, and you care about others, and you do a great job, and we\nwant to laugh and enjoy the fun things in your culture and celebrate\nour differences, like the fun we have with italian families, or the\ndrinking irish, or the fun we poke at the amish, or the fun we have\nwith gays, (who used to actually be enjoyed by communities, who are\nnow pissed off, thanks to lgbt!) or fun women drivers or \"hey you\nguys,\" or the formality of ladies and gentlemen. groups start for\ngood, but then when they arive to a point of growth and adjustments in\nsociety for further corrections, they go backward with extremes. such\nas feminist, good movement then extreme. black movement - good then\nextreme. when the extreme defines you, and now your group becomes\nselected for rights and freedoms, while the rest of society is forced\ninto giving theirs up, then you have gone from arrived, to going\nbackwards!!! i liked gays before this crap and after i now have trust\nissues, not because they are gay, but because of their activism. the\nextreme pushed your acceptance from general acceptance, even equal\nwithout discriminatory notice, to extreme overstepping into forced\nacceptance, then division and notice. you have to decide the goal, if\nyour goal is takeover, then your a jackass, and selfish, and un-\namerican! i grew up with alot of black friends, but when i went to a\ngrocery store and a few ignorant people decided that being black gave\nthem a right to walk through me, instead of equally being girls in a\ngrocery store, i was pissed! why because i dont like black people? or\nbecause i dont like people who want to force their will on me and\nbully me because they are black. now that was 30 years ago, why is\nthis more present, instead of history? because black people make being\nblack an issue, instead of making themselves equal, they want to\nenforce selective blackness, instead of celebrating blackness. same\ndeal w gays. we will never force change on people without creating\ndivisions and discrimination. even ben carson says, he grew up poor,\nworked hard and directed his life where he wanted. no one stopped him\nbecause he was black, and no one stopped him because he was poor. and\nhe didnt paint himself white or pretend he was white, or behave like\nhe was white. he embraced being american first, and being black 2nd.\nyet his own race call him names, uncle tom, playing the white game.\nnewsflash its not the white game he played, its the american game he\nplayed. there are some bad officers, but generally if white black\nspanish gay tatoo filled biker, or whatever, respect law enforcement,\nand if you respect them and they are still harsher than they should\nbe, sue them, or take them up the chain. but its not ok to wave your\narms around cuss the officer out, and appear threatening no matter who\nyou are, and as chris rock says, you probably wont get your ass\nkicked. but thats not what these groups want, and its not the messafe\nthey are giving to the people they claim to defend! instead they push\nthem further into the eye of the storm and divide society into the\ndiscrimination and into reverse discrimination hurting all of society\nincluding the people they say they are fighting for! most people feel\nlike i do, we are angry because we are being forced, and its divisive!\nim angry at groups like lbgt! and black lives matter! yet i have gay\nyoung adults at my house everyday! im angry because we have moved\nbeyond many things and these groups do the opposite of their supposed\nintention. we didnt even notice transgenders in our bathrooms till\nlgbt decided to make us notice! my daughter has a transgender friend\n(s)he is absolutely undetectable! we honestly wouldnt stare long\nenough to notice. so if you experience anger, thank lgbt. a same w\nblm! we want people to respect each others rights and share society.\nyou have bought some lies, christianity isnt your enemy, they are not\nbullying you. but also sexuality is a big deal to just about every\nreligion. and we have a right to believe what we want. and you do\nalso, if special interest groups would stop being bullies, we all\nwould be better off. we are a mixed up diverse group of americans! we\nlove ben carson, he is not black to anyone. i hate obama, black has\nnothing to do with it! the problem with the black special interest and\ngay special interest, isnt we dont like them! its we value being\namerican plain and simple ben carson, doesnt come out and say like me\nbecause i am black. he says like me because i am ben carson! the gay\nkids that come to my house dont say like me because i am gay, they say\nlike me because i am kind and a loyal friend, and i have value because\nof who i am, and also gay. not because i am gay i force you! divisive!\nread my letter to gays on this post, it applys to blm also! gay also\nhas sex attached, sex is morality. and everyone has a right to have a\nbelief and raise their children accordingly without influence forced\nupon their family and their values. exclusive laws to gain your\npersonal goals are acceptable. laws forced on all is not. i dont\nexpect everyone to like and agree with me, neiither should anyone\nelse. should the baker have to hire you, or bake a cake. well all\nshould be a protected class! she cant assume you are sexually in\nprivate offending god or her faith. as far as hiring every single\nperson should be able to sue if there is valid discrimination.\nexamples: i am 4'11\" italian considered caucasian, if i apply to the\nbaker and she hires an applicant with less crudentials, that should be\ninvestigated. as to why, what discrimination had her choose a less\nqualified applicant? if i am black same deal, but the black person and\nme should be on equal footing on possible discrimination. if i am gay,\nsame deal. she has no right to pry into privacy, privacy is a right.\nso when gays gain exclusive law, it wiuld be better to make their\nsexuality like hippa laws, a matter of choice and permission for a gay\nto share or not share their civil union status. and if she hires a\nlower quality applicant sue! but a wedding cake is different, because\nthats disclosure of sexuality in intent to marry, and that is her\nright to believe differently about family values, sexuality, and same\nsex marriage. so turning down the job is her right because she has\nreligious beliefs. and it is more beneficial for the gay to hire\nsomeone that is supportive or neutral, because no one wants to have\ntheir wedding filled with people who are forced to be there! why would\nanyone want that? you are welcome to go to churches and even start\nchurches that are ministries that have no moral beliefs in opposition\nto the sexual morality inclusive of gay couples. an exclusive laws can\nprotect you for everything without making people feel forced and\nresent you!

                " i have concerns about trump, mostly on his articulation and\nexperience, not just political experience but just being adequately\nstudied on political procedure and current events. he would need a\nreally strong cabinet, in areas he's not strong in. but as far as the\nstatement you made here, it\u2019s not actually a real or accurate\nevaluation of trump nor the situation surrounding trump. these\nstatement and other accusations are not sensible, logical arguments.\ntrump actually wants to protect people\u2019s rights. including women and\nblacks. you have to understand the personality of trump\u2026. i\u2019m a women\nand he doesn\u2019t bother me. he is a hot head. he is not politically\ncorrect. he steps in shit when he opens his mouth, not because his\nmotives are bad or evil, not because he is a dictator, and not because\nhe's a racist, or hates women. it\u2019s because he never really had to\npackage his words carefully, and he didn\u2019t intend to run for office.\ni\u2019m not saying trump is qualified in my opinion to be president. but,\ni am saying: many things you see at this time are provoked. he, trump,\nis a hot head, he is provoked. black lives matter are hotheads they\nare provoked. and they exploit and media exploits. much is taken out\nof context. many things trump has ever said in the past is just trump\nbeing trump. a celebrity, a big talker, a hot head, a real estate\ntycoon, a guy from new york. to vilifying trump is actually inaccurate\nand off base. he is not, and he should not be an excuse for a bunch of\npeople to make a platform, and lead the country by \u201cmob rules\nbehavior,\u201d and \u201cforce a power of influence and authority\u201d over\neveryone, through intimidation. i do have logically based concerns\nabout trump as president. such as \u2013 cruz brought to our attention that\ntrump is in litigation and may be sued for an expensive real estate\ncourse he ran, so being involved in that, depending on the details may\nbe a true, tangible, measurable and factual concern. the series of off\nthe cuff remarks made through his lifetime, many out of context, and\nothers in my opinion are just mouthy hot head words without a\npolitically correct filter! i didn\u2019t like his reaction to meagan kelly\nduring and after the first debate. but i don't see it as \u201chating women\nor devaluing women,\u201d i see it as he was backed into a corner, and he\nreally isn\u2019t accustomed to. and he doesn't adjust his reactions. he\nsimply is just rash, with brute honesty, wears his feelings and\nattitudes on his sleeve, and honestly just opens his mouth and steps\nin shit, and he does so in reaction at the moment, and in the heat of\nthe moment. trump is like many people i have experienced, and maybe,\neven a little like myself. so i get the crap that falls out of his\nmouth in the heat of the moment. but to vilify him by these things is\nmore of a salem witch hunt, than a true reasonable evaluation. i can\nsee why some people would say or feel things they do, or form opinions\nby what he has said or says. but there is a huge overreaction to all\nof it! and, it isn\u2019t balanced! here is trump in a nutshell: he is a\nhigh d personality with a secondary high i, he has a low level s and a\nlow level c. and that is his most likely his disc profile. (below is a\nbasic view of disc personality traits) d - dominant traits i -\ninspiring traits s \u2013 serving traits c \u2013 cautious traits so, i\u2019ll\nexplain why accusing trump of having an interest or a motive in taking\nrights away is an off base accusation. 1st of all, ask yourself why???\nwhy would he? and, why would he logically want to? 1st put yourself in\nperspective\u2026. your really not as important as you think you are to\ntrump. or, let\u2019s rephrase that to understand what i mean by that. he\nactually doesn\u2019t need to be president. i really think trump was\ndrinking a beer and said \u201dshit, i can fix this, maybe i should run for\npresident!\u201d there\u2019s a funny of trump facebook post that says that.\nbut, the real funny part of the post is, i think its closer to being\ntrue than not true!! he doesn\u2019t need to be president, he doesn\u2019t need\nyou, and he doesn\u2019t need to make you important to himself at all. he\ndoesn\u2019t need your approval in life, and he doesn\u2019t need, or want your\nrights! your life, your local economy, your future security, your\nunemployment or your ability or inability to charge a reasonable bid\nas a handyman because of competing below market bids on projects by\nunder the table alien workers - that take away your jobs and your\nincome potential and then leave you at a disadvantage, unable to take\ncare of yourself and your family! none of these things that affect\nyou, actually will ever affect trump or his family, at all. if mexican\nimmigrants get the jobs you didn\u2019t get. trump doesn\u2019t have to pay your\nmortgage, your electric, your grocery bill, and your education etc\u2026 to\ntrump, whether you have a job or not, really doesn\u2019t have any effect\non trump\u2019s life nor anyone he cares about! as far as terrorism, and\nyour safe traveling on commercial airplanes, that is the least\nimportant thing personally to trump! he has his own plane! he doesn\u2019t\nneed or want your social security check, your unemployment check, he\ndoesn\u2019t have to pay your healthcare or obamacare premiums, he doesn\u2019t\ncompete in your job market, he doesn\u2019t walk your streets and encounter\nyour neighborhood crime, nor does he encounter your area crime by\nundocumented immigrants who are or could be potential rapists\nmurderers or thieves! wait a minute, how dare he say that about\nillegal aliens, you bigot. now you wait, here is a little common sense\nthought you should also consider in forming your opinion. actually,\nillegals come in the usa without required records. we have no idea who\nor where they are, and we have no ability to do homework on them, on\ntheir background, or even their real names! because there is no id or\npassport required when you are illegal! so, through legal immigration,\nwe are more able to reject the entrance of criminals, and drug\nsmugglers. another thought, and please understand, i\u2019m making a point\nnot being cruel. but, the ones who come illegally, come from the\npoorest and most crime ridden areas of mexico. these are the people\nwho are the least likely to afford to come legally. now, compare\nbetween illegals and legals. allowing legals in the usa, we have more\nability to vet them and reject criminals, because it is required that\nthey have records, and ids and a passports. but illegals, there is a\nhigher chance of letting in criminals. 1 - because criminals can\u2019t\neasily come here legally, so they have to come illegally and 2 - most\nillegals are coming from the poorest areas that have the highest\nconcentration of crime. and illegals are traveling from these areas\nand with criminals. what they are fleeing, high crime, and poverty and\ndesperation is what they are bringing with them. without our ability\nto vet them, records, health records, criminal backgrounds, proof of\nid, passports! back to trump, he is a citizen like us, looking at\nareas the usa is messing up, and he is looking at these big problems\nand his possible solutions as a motivation and a platform, and he\nthinks he can fix it. whether he can or not, isn\u2019t relevant at the\nmoment. because we are discussing when you slice up trump, what\u2019s\ninside. his motives, his why. he didn\u2019t decide to run to prove\nhimself. he actually doesn\u2019t need to prove himself, especially not to\nyou or me. he didn\u2019t decide i feel like spending millions in running\nfor president, because that would be a prestigeous thing to do. he is\nbusiness wealthy, not politician wealthy. politicians have career goal\nleading to a presidential dream. trump probably didn\u2019t have this on\nhis career goal list, and probably not even on his jump out of a\nplane, ride the biggest roller coaster, buy an island \u2026. and\neverything else, bucket list! trumps business background: many\nsuccessful people had bankruptcies and use legal loopholes to build\nbusinesses. and atlantic city has been put out of business just about,\natlantic city is a big mess in the tristate area. because states who\ndidn\u2019t allow gambling, now do. so there are more local options for\ngambling and less people doing to atlantic city. so atlantic city\ntanked, atlantic municipality actually just shut down and closed their\ngovernment doors (for months or maybe more) because literally, they\u2019re\nbroke! so regardless, trump had great success, and is a business man.\nand, managing a big budget, of many businesses all at 1 time, and\nlowering expenses and deficiencies is something that is actually in\nhis wheelhouse! areas he sees as things that someone needs to step up\nand fix around here, in the usa. now, he is approaching issues from a\ncitizens perspective and business perspective and he is thinking, i\ncan fix this. someone has to get this stuff under a manageable\ncontrol, or it\u2019s going to face bankruptcy, maybe even bad credit,\ngovernment shut downs, refusal of future credit or ability to borrow,\nmaybe even foreclosure, or the inability to pay salaries, provide\nbenefits or funding or care or social security checks or welfare\nchecks or unemployment checks, or health care premiums in obamacare\u2026\netc. he sees policies that are hurting americans, and his approach is\nfrom a common sense citizen and a business perspective: 1- trading and\namerican businesses \u2013 trading goods with china and others, and\namerican companies who brought their business to other countries,\n(trump has bought, sold, and run companies abroad also) so as a\nbusiness person he answers the problem by strategies to strengthen\nopportunities, jobs, and make and sell more products locally, to\nstrengthen our economy, reduce inflation, and make life more\naffordable for everybody. make sense? this is a reasonable approach.\nand, this approach isn't selective of race, gender, sex orientation\netc\u2026 because it will help everyone across the board, and raise many\nblack and white people out of poverty, and there will be more money in\nour economy, in our local communities, and in households, and probably\nsignificantly will raise tax revenue from everyone, and for everyone\u2019s\nbenefit. bringing businesses home raise tax revenue from big business,\nwhich is big money, to add to our american pocketbook. 2- immigration\n- he doesn't hate mexicans, and he doesn't hate muslims. he hates \u201cthe\nproblems\u201d we have, that happen to include some people from these 2\ngroups. again, he is using a common sense citizen/businessman approach\nto problems and solutions. so 1st, lets all get in the driver seat,\nand lets all make the most logical determination for policies, in\nresponse to \u201call the problems.\u201d in our homes we can't pay the electric\nbill, and ignore the water bill. but, if push comes to shove, we may\ndo without a dinner out, or maybe, even do without cable tv for a few\nmonths. these are logical household management decisions that we all\nmay have had to make at sometime. apply the same principles to our\nproblems in the usa. in the same way, we have to divide our resources,\nand address everything and every problem in balance, according to\npriority and our future stability and safety. so when discussing the\nissue of immigration - 1st we have to define the problems and 2nd we\nhave to answer the problem. and we have to answer the problem with 1st\nmaking sure \u201cour own house\u201d has a reasonable ability to survive and\nthrive. and if we spread ourselves thin, that it\u2019s not too thin, and\nit won't add more damages to our already struggling family! - so, then\nregarding 1 problem with many sub- problems immigration: illegal\naliens, the potential for terrorism, the vetting process, the current\njob market in the usa, our own crime and then the added crime of some\nillegal aliens, our own struggles within our own communities and our\nown country - racial tensions, poverty, education, home land security,\nlaw enforcement, health insurance, medicare, our seniors,\nunemployment, underemploymwnt, international relationships, any and\nall issues, threats, and tensions, our military defense, intelligence,\nand military responsibilities and action, green card holders, and\nmore... etc... (reduce it all to small terms and apply a common sense\nexample) - we have a good little family, we are compassionate and help\nothers. but we have a limit on ability. we have limits on the good we\ncan do, and regardless of what we would like to do, the good we can do\nis limited by our ability and resources. we are limited by our own\nincome, our bills, our discretionary income, our by our own progress\nand goals as a family unit, and of each individual person within our\nown family. we also have many other obligations - our aging parents,\nother people that are directly in our path that have needs, planning\nour own years of retirement, and personal and our children\u2019s\neducation, and providing for the now and later needs and wants and\ngoals for ourselves, our children, and our grandchildren, and then\nalso more, other community involvements we are a part of like churches\nor other groups and charities that are important to us ... then\nwhatever is left over after we have met or managed the immediate\ndemands around us, what is leftover if any, is all that we have to\nwork with. we all have to understand, we just can't give everyone a\nbetter life, because 1 - it is not realistic 2 - it will hurt our\nimmediate and extended family. it would take from their basic needs,\nand also would put their future stability at risk 3 - it would prevent\nstability and goals both collectively and personally. hurting our\neconomic improvements, current growth, and future gains. well, the\ngovernment spending and budget- federal, state, and local are similar\nin comparison, but just on a way bigger and broader scale! so, when\ntrump says, \"close the boarder\" and \"build a wall,\" he isn't being\ncallus or a bigot. he is taking each of these real issues, i\nmentioned, effecting immigration and he is applying a common sense\napproach for answers according to the whole picture of immigration\ncombined with the whole picture of all the other issues in light of\nour household budget, our projected future earnings, and our already\naccrued rising national debt, along with the interest on the money we\nalready owe - (which is billions and growing by adding on top growing\nunpaid interest and also more added new debt from all the short falls\nfrom yearly spending we don\u2019t cover now by tax revenue. so this is our\nhousehold budget, and our spending and our bills are not even close to\nbeing covered. the debt grows and grows with what we don\u2019t cover in\ntaxes after our bills are paid. and that is huge!! so take issues\nsurrounding immigration, and answer it. understand the why, ask more\nquestions, see what we are willing to do without, and what we can\u2019t\nlive without. and if you cut from priority areas, like military or\nretirement social security or medicare or education. make sure you ask\nmore questions and more question and weigh every possible problem or\nconsequence. before you make your opinion, and chase idiot know it\nalls on the internet. those are likely to be the least educated among\nus. maybe even enemies of america for all you know!"

                " an answer to a debator defending legal actions against christians\nbased on \"sin is sin\" argument. religion is a protected class, and\nshould be! gays should not be a protected class, because hate against\nany group is equal hate! im a christian, and i dont think tatoos are a\nsin. others may, its their freedom to do so! born again religions, may\nnot judge where or why a person has tattoos, and likely wouldn't judge\ntheir tattos. they may have a story to tell, let them! a church i\nstepped into several years back in philly while handing out food and\nblankets with my church group refused to let me use their bathroom\nbecause i am a woman and was wearing pants. yhey may believe\ndifferently and are strict about other things that other churches are\nnot strict with. and it should be ok to believe either way, and i\ncould care less about what they believe, thats their business, my\nbeliefs are my business! tolerance, live and let live. i have a belly\nring, and one of my favorite people in the world is my baby, youngest\ndaughter, because she is sweet. she has a guage earing, and has had\npurple to teal hair since she was in jr high. wawa and starbucks won't\nhire her, because visually she has an unnatural color hair. but, there\nare plenty of jobs that will. so she chooses to keep her crazy colors,\nand work where they dont have an issue with it! many churches dont\nthink certain vices are sin, like smoking or social drinking. there\nare varying degrees of doctrines. thats why religious freedom is so\nimportant!!!! many sects if christianity are evem loose on sexual\npreference, most i know are strict. but it is not up to people, or\ngovernment, or courts to scruitinize anyone's beliefs including gays\nwho have religious beliefs that are inclusive of sexual orientaton,\nunless a real crime has been commited. just like freedom of speech of\nevery degree is protected! both speech and religious freedom are\npersonal expression regarding what they think and believe about\neverything that matters to them! disabilities are not a choice and\nbeing black isnt a choice either, although honestly, america needs to\nhead in a different direction where all people regardless of race, all\nare equaly protected, and not especially protected! protected classes\nshould be represented of all groups of people and found in every race\nand culture! such as disabilities, and religions, ages, and gender. i'\nll explain: religion because it effects all races, genders, classes,\nand found in every walk of life. every religion from christian to\nmuslim to jews etc, and also religions that are permissive, and are\ninclusive of gay membership and leadership should have religious\nfreedom. does it mean we won' t bump into each other at times, but how\nabout we behave politely and say excuse me! or ok discussed agree to\ndisagree! isnt that what a \"progressive\" society is all about!\ndisabilities protected because they need to compete according to the\nabilities they do have. and people with disabilities are present in\nevery group. and age, because they have to compete against younger\ncandidates, and again age is a factor for every group so it is\nselective of none. and women, because they need to compete equally\nagainst men who have different strengths, and women need to be able to\ncompete according to their strengths, and not limited by the\nweaknesses they may present in a workplace, physically, or even\nregards to future pregnancies, birth, maternity leaves, sick kids, and\nother family responsibilities that could cause bias or expense of down\ntime or added health insurance costs. up till recently health\ninsurances have been higher because of reproduction. an example are\nthe nuns who recently fought cost of health insurance inclusive of\nreproductive ability. and they are abstinent, (except for some who\nchange their mind and take directions leading out of the vocation) the\nfollowing groups of classes are across the board represented in every\nsingle group of race and culture. so american 1st! america is multi\ncultural so every culture should be protected classes - american 1st,\nand white 2nd, italian 2nd, black 2nd, gay 2nd, married 2nd, single\n2nd, economic class 2nd. but in every american group of people, there\nare equally specific groups whovshould be protection from\ndiscrimination. and its reasonable, because it puts competing equal\nfor all in every group. but it can't be given above religious freedom\nof all, or its selective group breeching separation of church and\nstate because then it prohibits the free exercise of religion for all,\nexcept for 1 such as lgbt. sexual orientation should not be a\nprotected class. it's a lifestyle, and sexual choice. even if you\nbelieve it was genetic, every baby is born with the same option of\nchoice, and genetic or not can choose it. but in common every group\nhas: disabled, age, gender, and religion. we as a society should have\nmoved beyond the racial division to the next phase atleast 10 years\nago. not adding more divisions!! there will always be bullies, for\neveryone, in every group. reverse discrimination is just as much a\nproblem as discrimination!! the baker could even be an example of\nthis, she was signaled out in reverse discrimination, legally, for her\nbeliefs. yet not 1 case invoving muslims was brought forth even though\nthey believe the same. there is footage showing 3 muslim bakeries who\nalso would not make a cake against their own religious beliefs!\ndiscrimination for sexual orientation opens religions up for open\nhunting season as targets to be abused by anyone who is sexually\noriented protected. re: transgender bathroom laws: we were not likely\naware or able to notice transgenders in bathrooms. but creating laws,\nprotecting them in discriminations and allowing choice of bathrooms\nare also open hunting season by anyone who wants to exploit others,\nfor personal gain, political media attention, or both, and also for\npreditors. so if transgenders are really living like their identity,\nthen go in, close the door, and dont draw unneeded attention. and live\namd let live! if arrested, there is defense! you dont need a law for\nthat! bring your doctors report and it isnt an issue! maybe an\nexclusive allowance if identified could prevent problems instead of\ncreating them. nc didnt randomly make a law, they made it in response\nto extreme demands made by groups like lgbt! so be mad at them! the\nproblem is, special interest groups want to be special, superior,\nstand out, have special privelages, and allowances. they want to be\nable to control society, and discrimination laws are a license to\ncontrol and abuse others. they are only divisive, and cause unfairness\nto others resulting in further discrimination, and reverse\ndiscrimination! and this is the liberals play ground, the more\nproblems they create, the more it looks like you all need them! there\nwill always be hate crimes for everyone. fat, ugly, body shaming, gay,\nshort, black, white, spanish, asian etc. compete as americans, put\nthese divisive groups out! and we will be the america we intended to\nbe since 1776! religious freedom was and is inclusive of all. it is\nours by constitutional guarantee! society corrected many issues,\nspecial interest groups stop progress by extremes! now its time to\nmove past it all and simply be american. making some groups a\nprotected class, leaves others unprotected ex. the baker, florist, and\nthe marriage certificate clerk. all who should have had resposible\nsociety step in and protect them, and provide alternatives of other\nbusinesses, or signers. these exclusive special interest groups are\ndivisive. examples: making an excluse black statement, and forcing us\nto see you as black is counter productive. we dont want to \"have\" to\nlike you because you are black. we want to like you because you have\nintegrity, and you care about others, and you do a great job, and we\nwant to laugh and enjoy the fun things in your culture and celebrate\nour differences, like the fun we have with italian families, or the\ndrinking irish, or the fun we poke at the amish, or the fun we have\nwith gays, (who used to actually be enjoyed by communities, who are\nnow pissed off, thanks to lgbt!) or fun women drivers or \"hey you\nguys,\" or the formality of ladies and gentlemen. groups start for\ngood, but then when they arive to a point of growth and adjustments in\nsociety for further corrections, they go backward with extremes. such\nas feminist, good movement then extreme. black movement - good then\nextreme. when the extreme defines you, and now your group becomes\nselected for rights and freedoms, while the rest of society is forced\ninto giving theirs up, then you have gone from arrived, to going\nbackwards!!! i liked gays before this crap and after i now have trust\nissues, not because they are gay, but because of their activism. the\nextreme pushed your acceptance from general acceptance, even equal\nwithout discriminatory notice, to extreme overstepping into forced\nacceptance, then division and notice. you have to decide the goal, if\nyour goal is takeover, then your a jackass, and selfish, and un-\namerican! i grew up with alot of black friends, but when i went to a\ngrocery store and a few ignorant people decided that being black gave\nthem a right to walk through me, instead of equally being girls in a\ngrocery store, i was pissed! why because i dont like black people? or\nbecause i dont like people who want to force their will on me and\nbully me because they are black. now that was 30 years ago, why is\nthis more present, instead of history? because black people make being\nblack an issue, instead of making themselves equal, they want to\nenforce selective blackness, instead of celebrating blackness. same\ndeal w gays. we will never force change on people without creating\ndivisions and discrimination. even ben carson says, he grew up poor,\nworked hard and directed his life where he wanted. no one stopped him\nbecause he was black, and no one stopped him because he was poor. and\nhe didnt paint himself white or pretend he was white, or behave like\nhe was white. he embraced being american first, and being black 2nd.\nyet his own race call him names, uncle tom, playing the white game.\nnewsflash its not the white game he played, its the american game he\nplayed. there are some bad officers, but generally if white black\nspanish gay tatoo filled biker, or whatever, respect law enforcement,\nand if you respect them and they are still harsher than they should\nbe, sue them, or take them up the chain. but its not ok to wave your\narms around cuss the officer out, and appear threatening no matter who\nyou are, and as chris rock says, you probably wont get your ass\nkicked. but thats not what these groups want, and its not the messafe\nthey are giving to the people they claim to defend! instead they push\nthem further into the eye of the storm and divide society into the\ndiscrimination and into reverse discrimination hurting all of society\nincluding the people they say they are fighting for! most people feel\nlike i do, we are angry because we are being forced, and its divisive!\nim angry at groups like lbgt! and black lives matter! yet i have gay\nyoung adults at my house everyday! im angry because we have moved\nbeyond many things and these groups do the opposite of their supposed\nintention. we didnt even notice transgenders in our bathrooms till\nlgbt decided to make us notice! my daughter has a transgender friend\n(s)he is absolutely undetectable! we honestly wouldnt stare long\nenough to notice. so if you experience anger, thank lgbt. a same w\nblm! we want people to respect each others rights and share society.\nyou have bought some lies, christianity isnt your enemy, they are not\nbullying you. but also sexuality is a big deal to just about every\nreligion. and we have a right to believe what we want. and you do\nalso, if special interest groups would stop being bullies, we all\nwould be better off. we are a mixed up diverse group of americans! we\nlove ben carson, he is not black to anyone. i hate obama, black has\nnothing to do with it! the problem with the black special interest and\ngay special interest, isnt we dont like them! its we value being\namerican plain and simple ben carson, doesnt come out and say like me\nbecause i am black. he says like me because i am ben carson! the gay\nkids that come to my house dont say like me because i am gay, they say\nlike me because i am kind and a loyal friend, and i have value because\nof who i am, and also gay. not because i am gay i force you! divisive!\nread my letter to gays on this post, it applys to blm also! gay also\nhas sex attached, sex is morality. and everyone has a right to have a\nbelief and raise their children accordingly without influence forced\nupon their family and their values. exclusive laws to gain your\npersonal goals are acceptable. laws forced on all is not. i dont\nexpect everyone to like and agree with me, neiither should anyone\nelse. should the baker have to hire you, or bake a cake. well all\nshould be a protected class! she cant assume you are sexually in\nprivate offending god or her faith. as far as hiring every single\nperson should be able to sue if there is valid discrimination.\nexamples: i am 4'11\" italian considered caucasian, if i apply to the\nbaker and she hires an applicant with less crudentials, that should be\ninvestigated. as to why, what discrimination had her choose a less\nqualified applicant? if i am black same deal, but the black person and\nme should be on equal footing on possible discrimination. if i am gay,\nsame deal. she has no right to pry into privacy, privacy is a right.\nso when gays gain exclusive law, it wiuld be better to make their\nsexuality like hippa laws, a matter of choice and permission for a gay\nto share or not share their civil union status. and if she hires a\nlower quality applicant sue! but a wedding cake is different, because\nthats disclosure of sexuality in intent to marry, and that is her\nright to believe differently about family values, sexuality, and same\nsex marriage. so turning down the job is her right because she has\nreligious beliefs. and it is more beneficial for the gay to hire\nsomeone that is supportive or neutral, because no one wants to have\ntheir wedding filled with people who are forced to be there! why would\nanyone want that? you are welcome to go to churches and even start\nchurches that are ministries that have no moral beliefs in opposition\nto the sexual morality inclusive of gay couples. an exclusive laws can\nprotect you for everything without making people feel forced and\nresent you! force will make anyone resent anyone!!!! there are better\nsolutions to your issues in society, and the lgbt agenda isnt one of\nthem. and neither is blm. be american! not black not white not gay not"

                " i have concerns about trump, mostly on his articulation and\nexperience, not just political experience but just being adequately\nstudied on political procedure and current events. he would need a\nreally strong cabinet, in areas he's not strong in. but as far as the\nstatement you made here, it\u2019s not actually a real or accurate\nevaluation of trump nor the situation surrounding trump. these\nstatement and other accusations are not sensible, logical arguments.\ntrump actually wants to protect people\u2019s rights. including women and\nblacks. you have to understand the personality of trump\u2026. i\u2019m a women\nand he doesn\u2019t bother me. he is a hot head. he is not politically\ncorrect. he steps in shit when he opens his mouth, not because his\nmotives are bad or evil, not because he is a dictator, and not because\nhe's a racist, or hates women. it\u2019s because he never really had to\npackage his words carefully, and he didn\u2019t intend to run for office.\ni\u2019m not saying trump is qualified in my opinion to be president. but,\ni am saying: many things you see at this time are provoked. he, trump,\nis a hot head, he is provoked. black lives matter are hotheads they\nare provoked. and they exploit and media exploits. much is taken out\nof context. many things trump has ever said in the past is just trump\nbeing trump. a celebrity, a big talker, a hot head, a real estate\ntycoon, a guy from new york. to vilifying trump is actually inaccurate\nand off base. he is not, and he should not be an excuse for a bunch of\npeople to make a platform, and lead the country by \u201cmob rules\nbehavior,\u201d and \u201cforce a power of influence and authority\u201d over\neveryone, through intimidation. i do have logically based concerns\nabout trump as president. such as \u2013 cruz brought to our attention that\ntrump is in litigation and may be sued for an expensive real estate\ncourse he ran, so being involved in that, depending on the details may\nbe a true, tangible, measurable and factual concern. the series of off\nthe cuff remarks made through his lifetime, many out of context, and\nothers in my opinion are just mouthy hot head words without a\npolitically correct filter! i didn\u2019t like his reaction to meagan kelly\nduring and after the first debate. but i don't see it as \u201chating women\nor devaluing women,\u201d i see it as he was backed into a corner, and he\nreally isn\u2019t accustomed to. and he doesn't adjust his reactions. he\nsimply is just rash, with brute honesty, wears his feelings and\nattitudes on his sleeve, and honestly just opens his mouth and steps\nin shit, and he does so in reaction at the moment, and in the heat of\nthe moment. trump is like many people i have experienced, and maybe,\neven a little like myself. so i get the crap that falls out of his\nmouth in the heat of the moment. but to vilify him by these things is\nmore of a salem witch hunt, than a true reasonable evaluation. i can\nsee why some people would say or feel things they do, or form opinions\nby what he has said or says. but there is a huge overreaction to all\nof it! and, it isn\u2019t balanced! here is trump in a nutshell: he is a\nhigh d personality with a secondary high i, he has a low level s and a\nlow level c. and that is his most likely his disc profile. (below is a\nbasic view of disc personality traits) d - dominant traits i -\ninspiring traits s \u2013 serving traits c \u2013 cautious traits so, i\u2019ll\nexplain why accusing trump of having an interest or a motive in taking\nrights away is an off base accusation. 1st of all, ask yourself why???\nwhy would he? and, why would he logically want to? 1st put yourself in\nperspective\u2026. your really not as important as you think you are to\ntrump. or, let\u2019s rephrase that to understand what i mean by that. he\nactually doesn\u2019t need to be president. i really think trump was\ndrinking a beer and said \u201dshit, i can fix this, maybe i should run for\npresident!\u201d there\u2019s a funny of trump facebook post that says that.\nbut, the real funny part of the post is, i think its closer to being\ntrue than not true!! he doesn\u2019t need to be president, he doesn\u2019t need\nyou, and he doesn\u2019t need to make you important to himself at all. he\ndoesn\u2019t need your approval in life, and he doesn\u2019t need, or want your\nrights! your life, your local economy, your future security, your\nunemployment or your ability or inability to charge a reasonable bid\nas a handyman because of competing below market bids on projects by\nunder the table alien workers - that take away your jobs and your\nincome potential and then leave you at a disadvantage, unable to take\ncare of yourself and your family! none of these things that affect\nyou, actually will ever affect trump or his family, at all. if mexican\nimmigrants get the jobs you didn\u2019t get. trump doesn\u2019t have to pay your\nmortgage, your electric, your grocery bill, and your education etc\u2026 to\ntrump, whether you have a job or not, really doesn\u2019t have any effect\non trump\u2019s life nor anyone he cares about! as far as terrorism, and\nyour safe traveling on commercial airplanes, that is the least\nimportant thing personally to trump! he has his own plane! he doesn\u2019t\nneed or want your social security check, your unemployment check, he\ndoesn\u2019t have to pay your healthcare or obamacare premiums, he doesn\u2019t\ncompete in your job market, he doesn\u2019t walk your streets and encounter\nyour neighborhood crime, nor does he encounter your area crime by\nundocumented immigrants who are or could be potential rapists\nmurderers or thieves! wait a minute, how dare he say that about\nillegal aliens, you bigot. now you wait, here is a little common sense\nthought you should also consider in forming your opinion. actually,\nillegals come in the usa without required records. we have no idea who\nor where they are, and we have no ability to do homework on them, on\ntheir background, or even their real names! because there is no id or\npassport required when you are illegal! so, through legal immigration,\nwe are more able to reject the entrance of criminals, and drug\nsmugglers. another thought, and please understand, i\u2019m making a point\nnot being cruel. but, the ones who come illegally, come from the\npoorest and most crime ridden areas of mexico. these are the people\nwho are the least likely to afford to come legally. now, compare\nbetween illegals and legals. allowing legals in the usa, we have more\nability to vet them and reject criminals, because it is required that\nthey have records, and ids and a passports. but illegals, there is a\nhigher chance of letting in criminals. 1 - because criminals can\u2019t\neasily come here legally, so they have to come illegally and 2 - most\nillegals are coming from the poorest areas that have the highest\nconcentration of crime. and illegals are traveling from these areas\nand with criminals. what they are fleeing, high crime, and poverty and\ndesperation is what they are bringing with them. without our ability\nto vet them, records, health records, criminal backgrounds, proof of\nid, passports! back to trump, he is a citizen like us, looking at\nareas the usa is messing up, and he is looking at these big problems\nand his possible solutions as a motivation and a platform, and he\nthinks he can fix it. whether he can or not, isn\u2019t relevant at the\nmoment. because we are discussing when you slice up trump, what\u2019s\ninside. his motives, his why. he didn\u2019t decide to run to prove\nhimself. he actually doesn\u2019t need to prove himself, especially not to\nyou or me. he didn\u2019t decide i feel like spending millions in running\nfor president, because that would be a prestigeous thing to do. he is\nbusiness wealthy, not politician wealthy. politicians have career goal\nleading to a presidential dream. trump probably didn\u2019t have this on\nhis career goal list, and probably not even on his jump out of a\nplane, ride the biggest roller coaster, buy an island \u2026. and\neverything else, bucket list! trumps business background: many\nsuccessful people had bankruptcies and use legal loopholes to build\nbusinesses. and atlantic city has been put out of business just about,\natlantic city is a big mess in the tristate area. because states who\ndidn\u2019t allow gambling, now do. so there are more local options for\ngambling and less people doing to atlantic city. so atlantic city\ntanked, atlantic municipality actually just shut down and closed their\ngovernment doors (for months or maybe more) because literally, they\u2019re\nbroke! so regardless, trump had great success, and is a business man.\nand, managing a big budget, of many businesses all at 1 time, and\nlowering expenses and deficiencies is something that is actually in\nhis wheelhouse! areas he sees as things that someone needs to step up\nand fix around here, in the usa. now, he is approaching issues from a\ncitizens perspective and business perspective and he is thinking, i\ncan fix this. someone has to get this stuff under a manageable\ncontrol, or it\u2019s going to face bankruptcy, maybe even bad credit,\ngovernment shut downs, refusal of future credit or ability to borrow,\nmaybe even foreclosure, or the inability to pay salaries, provide\nbenefits or funding or care or social security checks or welfare\nchecks or unemployment checks, or health care premiums in obamacare\u2026\netc. he sees policies that are hurting americans, and his approach is\nfrom a common sense citizen and a business perspective: 1- trading and\namerican businesses \u2013 trading goods with china and others, and\namerican companies who brought their business to other countries,\n(trump has bought, sold, and run companies abroad also) so as a\nbusiness person he answers the problem by strategies to strengthen\nopportunities, jobs, and make and sell more products locally, to\nstrengthen our economy, reduce inflation, and make life more\naffordable for everybody. make sense? this is a reasonable approach.\nand, this approach isn't selective of race, gender, sex orientation\netc\u2026 because it will help everyone across the board, and raise many\nblack and white people out of poverty, and there will be more money in\nour economy, in our local communities, and in households, and probably\nsignificantly will raise tax revenue from everyone, and for everyone\u2019s\nbenefit. bringing businesses home raise tax revenue from big business,\nwhich is big money, to add to our american pocketbook. 2- immigration\n- he doesn't hate mexicans, and he doesn't hate muslims. he hates \u201cthe\nproblems\u201d we have, that happen to include some people from these 2\ngroups. again, he is using a common sense citizen/businessman approach\nto problems and solutions. so 1st, lets all get in the driver seat,\nand lets all make the most logical determination for policies, in\nresponse to \u201call the problems.\u201d in our homes we can't pay the electric\nbill, and ignore the water bill. but, if push comes to shove, we may\ndo without a dinner out, or maybe, even do without cable tv for a few\nmonths. these are logical household management decisions that we all\nmay have had to make at sometime. apply the same principles to our\nproblems in the usa. in the same way, we have to divide our resources,\nand address everything and every problem in balance, according to\npriority and our future stability and safety. so when discussing the\nissue of immigration - 1st we have to define the problems and 2nd we\nhave to answer the problem. and we have to answer the problem with 1st\nmaking sure \u201cour own house\u201d has a reasonable ability to survive and\nthrive. and if we spread ourselves thin, that it\u2019s not too thin, and\nit won't add more damages to our already struggling family! - so, then\nregarding 1 problem with many sub- problems immigration: illegal\naliens, the potential for terrorism, the vetting process, the current\njob market in the usa, our own crime and then the added crime of some\nillegal aliens, our own struggles within our own communities and our\nown country - racial tensions, poverty, education, home land security,\nlaw enforcement, health insurance, medicare, our seniors,\nunemployment, underemploymwnt, international relationships, any and\nall issues, threats, and tensions, our military defense, intelligence,\nand military responsibilities and action, green card holders, and\nmore... etc... (reduce it all to small terms and apply a common sense\nexample) - we have a good little family, we are compassionate and help\nothers. but we have a limit on ability. we have limits on the good we\ncan do, and regardless of what we would like to do, the good we can do\nis limited by our ability and resources. we are limited by our own\nincome, our bills, our discretionary income, our by our own progress\nand goals as a family unit, and of each individual person within our\nown family. we also have many other obligations - our aging parents,\nother people that are directly in our path that have needs, planning\nour own years of retirement, and personal and our children\u2019s\neducation, and providing for the now and later needs and wants and\ngoals for ourselves, our children, and our grandchildren, and then\nalso more, other community involvements we are a part of like churches\nor other groups and charities that are important to us ... then\nwhatever is left over after we have met or managed the immediate\ndemands around us, what is leftover if any, is all that we have to\nwork with. we all have to understand, we just can't give everyone a\nbetter life, because 1 - it is not realistic 2 - it will hurt our\nimmediate and extended family. it would take from their basic needs,\nand also would put their future stability at risk 3 - it would prevent\nstability and goals both collectively and personally. hurting our\neconomic improvements, current growth, and future gains. well, the\ngovernment spending and budget- federal, state, and local are similar\nin comparison, but just on a way bigger and broader scale! so, when\ntrump says, \"close the boarder\" and \"build a wall,\" he isn't being\ncallus or a bigot. he is taking each of these real issues, i\nmentioned, effecting immigration and he is applying a common sense\napproach for answers according to the whole picture of immigration\ncombined with the whole picture of all the other issues in light of\nour household budget, our projected future earnings, and our already\naccrued rising national debt, along with the interest on the money we\nalready owe - (which is billions and growing by adding on top growing\nunpaid interest and also more added new debt from all the short falls\nfrom yearly spending we don\u2019t cover now by tax revenue. so this is our\nhousehold budget, and our spending and our bills are not even close to\nbeing covered. the debt grows and grows with what we don\u2019t cover in\ntaxes after our bills are paid. and that is huge!! so take issues\nsurrounding immigration, and answer it. understand the why, ask more\nquestions, see what we are willing to do without, and what we can\u2019t\nlive without. and if you cut from priority areas, like military or\nretirement social security or medicare or education. make sure you ask\nmore questions and more question and weigh every possible problem or\nconsequence. before you make your opinion, and chase idiot know it\nalls on the internet. those are likely to be the least educated among\nus. maybe even enemies of america for all you know!",

it's not a justification, it's stating the truth. a\njustification is, essentially, making an excuse. that is not what i am\ndoing. unlike you. if you're justified in a particular belief, then\nyou have a good reason for having it. if you are not justified, but\nyou wish to appear justified, then you make excuses. your\njustification for how and when freedom should be\nlimited/constrained/restricted is based on property rights. but you\nhold an inconsistent belief, that freedom is inherently good while\nfinding cause to limit it. you also find it necessary to change the\nword from \"violence\" to \"force\" because you don't like the fact that\nyou are comfortable initiating violence under certain conditions (such\nas protection of persons or property). if your only response to this\ncritique is to assert that what you say is true, then you're ignoring\ntruth in favor of your comfortable, though baseless opinion. i am not\nin favor of restricting freedom. i am in favor of protecting it. and\nmaximizing it. but that entails recognizing and acting according to\nobjective right and wrong. doing the right action and avoiding the\nwrong. maximizing freedom means restricting the freedom of those who\nwould restrict the freedom of others, such as an attacker. the\nattacker cannot be left free to attack. but this also means that any\nrestriction of freedom done in response rather than in defense must be\nleft to an independent power. in other words, after the attacker has\nattacked and left, retribution must come only after due process and in\naccordance with a pre-established punishment (law). the alternative is\nblood feuds and gang wars. how so?

                " ezekiel, daniel, and a few other prophets focus on end times\nprophesies along with revelations, and some of what jesus said direct.\nthe bible an instruction manual, explains every detail for\nunderstanding, and then also a time keeper for us to show us where we\nare and what's next. it's written to his people and as time\nprogresses, \"at the appointed time\" god opens the playback within the\npages of the \"football\" to reveals things, times, events, rebellions,\neverything from the catholic midevil dark ages to religious freedom,\nto extreme depravity all recorded in the \"football,\" in order to keep\nhis people on track, and give warnings, and instructions and commands\nfor preparations for his people to stay on the side of the light as\neverything goes down! and while he shows his people, he blinds\neveryone else. blinding them so they \"stumble at noonday\" \"the sun\nwill be darkened, the moon will not give its light, stars fall, earthy\nquakes\" if you read through the prophets isaiah jeremiah ezekiel all\nof them, this \"violent bible\" as people accuse, is actually a\nrevealing of everything from beginning to end. which currently we are\nabout 6000 years since the story of creation. 6 days! the word of god\nis like moving \"a football\" through time. like a football the\npresidents pass with all the informations and codes needed to defence\nand procedure. so i posted ezekiel 38, here because it's pertinent to\nwhat we see happening today. this is an end time prophesy. and islamic\nextremism is a key player, as they hate israel and the us whether we\nadmit or not is considered a christian nation, as well as which\nchristianity is part of judaism, when passing the football. also\nmuslims are part of the football. here is a prophesy given about\nishmael, now this is part of the football. there are lots of parts.\nbut it's significant. gog is the use of the many nations and the\nspirit of ishmael. his blood is in many nations, and we see this\nenmity and strife set as a part of the football. and russia is\nsignificant, turkey, and the \"horn\" of africa. we see beasts with\nhorns in the bible apocalyptic prophesies. and note its very\ninteresting, the prophesy discusses in verse 10 -\u2018thus says the lord\ngod, \u201cit will come about on that day, that thoughts will come into\nyour mind and you will devise an evil plan, 11 and you will say, \u2018i\nwill go up against the land of unwalled villages. i will go against\nthose who are at rest, that live securely, all of them living without\nwalls and having no bars or gates its interesting with all the\npolitical discussions of open borders and the funny \"wall\" discussions\nof our day israel and the usa and other allie nations, the united\nnations, and all political, geographical, and islamic extremism is all\npart of the \"football\" here is a prophesy regarding ishmael - genesis\n16 8 he said, \u201chagar, sarai\u2019s maid, where have you come from and where\nare you going?\u201d and she said, \u201ci am fleeing from the presence of my\nmistress sarai.\u201d 9 then the angel of the lord said to her, \u201creturn to\nyour mistress, and submit yourself to her authority.\u201d 10 moreover, the\nangel of the lord said to her, \u201ci will greatly multiply your\ndescendants so that they will be too many to count.\u201d 11 the angel of\nthe lord said to her further, \u201cbehold, you are with child, and you\nwill bear a son; and you shall call his name ishmael, because the lord\nhas given heed to your affliction. 12 \u201che will be a wild donkey of a\nman, his hand will be against everyone, and everyone\u2019s hand will be\nagainst him; and he will live to the east of all his brothers.\u201d and\ngog did mix with decendents of ishmael. so my point in posting is how\nfar liberals have taken the usa from the founding fathers intent, and\nthe self declarations of the liberal populous, \"we are not a christian\nnation\" with a fist up! so as we are being torn up from within and\nwithout, by \"bowls of wrath being poured out,\" from revelations, and\nactually some are being poured out, already! as we stand, and we don't\neven know it! but as the us puts their fist up against god, so in\nessence, we declared war against god. and its a sad day, but a joyous\nday. in 1 sense sad because the hate and violence is dancing in the\nopen like never before, its shocking to the reasonable mind! yet\nalmost acceptable and natural to the mind that is like the wild\nanimal, \"or beast\" the \"mind of a beast\" and the becoming minds like\nbeasts is also recorded to happen in the football. but in another\nsense joyous because we are coming to the end of the whole game. and\nthat means jesus is coming soon and for his people, we'll we look\nforward to it. it's a double edge sword, separating darkness to more\ndarkness and light to more light. so benghazi is an example of the\nmind of the beast in leadership, with gog tearing us as another beast.\nand every bit of it is judgement. and the blood spilled of these men,\nis on the heads of both of these beasts."

                " this debate has covered most points and counter points and has\ndevolved into repetition. so i'll try to answer the few specific\nquestions and then make my case one last time. you can read about\nappalachian troubles and a first hand account in hillbilly elegy. an\nauthor at ourworldindata.org put together graphs to visualize\nethnographic and archaeological evidence on violent deaths. some\nancient societies fared much better than others on this front, but on\nthe whole, violent death was 50 times more prevalent. your answer to\nspecific questions is always \"somehow\". how do you expect people\nwithout written laws to solve x dispute? somehow. how do you expect\npeople to seek a fair trial (due process) without laws? somehow. the\nbig problem you would face if all the institutions crumbled today is\nthis. the few like you would hunker down or wander off and hope the\nnext group of thieves aren't more armed because in anarchy, might is\nsuccessful, whether you feel it's right or not. the rest of us would\nform governments to guide might, constrain force and violence,\nstipulate consistent consequences for wrongs, and seek the fairest\nprocess by which guilt is determined. due process is not a natural\nright. it's a legislated right in place to protect the innocent and it\narises due to the high degree of fallibility of vigilantism. it does\nnot exist without laws because it is the law for how to determine\npunishable guilt. given the fact that due process is literally and\nnecessarily a host of laws, it cannot exist without government. there\nis no \"somehow\" to have due process in anarchy. when you go marching\noff to kill the killer, only to find too late that the supposed killer\nwas defending himself, isn't the right person, did it completely by\naccident, or any of a number of mitigating factors, you can tell the\nlynch mob coming for you that you know you are right because you know\nthe truth, but they will not be convinced. especially not when they're\nactually right and what you insist is truth turns out to be misguided\nopinion that lead you to murder someone. just as due process in\ncriminal law is created to protect the innocent from incorrect\nretribution, the process of civil law is created to fairly determine\nappropriate restitution. these are human institutions so of course\nthey can get it wrong. however, they reduce the amount of human error\nin retribution and restitution. your so called anarchy maximizes it.\ntrue conflicts of restitution and of retribution both necessitate an\nirresistible independent arbiter for resolution. the alternative is a\nworld of tyrants where it doesn't matter whether might makes right so\nlong as might is effective. your position is one of rousseauian\nidealism and subjectivism. it shares much with other utopian\nideologies. you will convince very few so long as you insist on having\nthe truth while neglecting to provide any basis beyond that assertion.\nif you choose to respond to this and the response is as repetitive as\nthis discussion has become, you can skip it. it would be sufficient to\njust assume i disagree. that's what i will do rather than responding.",

                " the estblishment republicans lacked the guts to take away all the\nfree stuff giving out by democrats no matter that it was all\nunsustainable. we needed castostrophic choices to be able to afford\nhealth insurance. there are not enough conservatives in our government\nto accomplish what must be done before our nation goes bankrupt. now\nour nation is stuck with obamacare which is collapsing. republicans\ncould not repeal obamacare because they were forced to try and leave\nall the free stuff to people that we could not afford. free stuff\nhanded out by corrupt democrats whose only goal in life is to buy\nvotes with middle class tax payer's money. we all understand how hard\nit is to take away a free giveaway program even if it was totally\nunsustainable as was this failed socialized obamacare. this healthcare\nbill could never succede because it forced the middle class to\nsubsidise these people who were added to the medicaid and insurance\nroles. these middle class families could no longer afford insurance\nfor their own famiies because they had to subsidise so many others. it\ncould never work but the democrats pushed it through anyways, and they\ndid so by adding all kinds of mandated coverage whether it be birth\ncontrol, abortion, mental, vision, etc. etc. they never should have\nforced coverage for everything on all americans. old people can't\nafford to pay for maternity coverage when they themselves would never\nuse it. young people can't afford to pay for all these mandated\ncoverages when they themselves do not need them. we needed choices for\ncoverages such as castostrophic plans that would not cost so\npathetically high as obamacare. americans could pay for the small\ndoctors bills for colds and flues, broken legs, etc. but needed\ncastotrophic plans for cancer, heart attacks, etc. democrats said no\nway! socialism for all with all health coverages! but now that obama\nand democrats spoiled the electorate, saying that money grows on\ntrees, and that they can have free heathcare, or stay on your parents\ninsurance, or get insurance at affordable premiums no matter how sick\nyou are, etc. etc., then it was an impossible task for republicans to\nkeep all these things and still keep the premiums from constantly\ngoing up. democrats created a socialistic type of healthcare that this\nnation can not afford. they refused to admit that the millions of\npeople added to their obamacare was not sustainable! it would be great\nif any nation could give everyone free healthcare (with all types of\nmandated coverage), but that is a fairy tale. our nation is going\nbankrupt."

Should vaccines be forced Hello Y, Certainly. The overriding purpose
of the U.S. Constitution is to “promote the general welfare”. You
can’t do that if you let a pandemic run wild in your country. excon

				I am not spreading diseases If you don't vaccine you have every
				capability of contracting and spreading a disease. Just look at the
				rise in measles due to anti-vaccers. you don't have the right, to live
				off of my body No one is living off your body, I have no idea where
				you are getting that from. I will not be vaccinated, even if someone
				might die That. Right there. That is the problem we have. You don't
				care if you kill people so long as you can freely say you have the
				right to choose. Those are your own words. So damn the consequences,
				damn the rest of the world and the innocent people you could
				potentially murder, damn the families and friends you could
				contaminate, damn every innocent person that does what they can to
				protect others. So long as you get to do what you want, it doesn't

				A vaccine is developed in response to particular iteration of a
				virus. People who are not vaccinated can contract the virus which
				provides an opportunity for the virus to mutate, rendering existing
				vaccinations ineffectual. The success of vaccination is therefore very
				much contingent upon an adequate number of people receiving the
				vaccination, and not receiving a vaccination does represent a choice
				which might endanger the well-being of others. That alone is not
				enough to justify mandatory vaccination, but your objection is
				misinformed.
				[Posted by Jace at 2020-04-29T08:56:17+00:00 - Side: Yes.]

			There is definitely room for substantive disagreement on that count,
			particularly where legal claims are concerned. We are not obliged to
			donate blood, even to relatives, even though that choice does affect
			others (and may even affect whether they live or die). There is no
			absolute right to life (let alone well-being), and any claim against
			another person leveraged on that grounds must therefore justify itself
			against the cost to that person. Perhaps that can be done in the case
			of vaccination, but a mere assertion that we cannot exercise autonomy
			over our bodies when doing so affects others is simply insufficient.
			Edit: Shoot, sorry. I did not realize you were banned before
			responding. :(

	There is no singular purpose laid out by the Constitution of the
	United States. Numerous purposes are enumerated alongside promoting
	the general welfare, and both legislation and jurisprudence have held
	these purposes to be non-absolute. The exceptional individualism of
	American culture, historically and at present, relative to other
	countries also cuts against your claim that the overriding purpose of
	the nation is to promote the general welfare. Moreover, what
	constitutes the general welfare is open to myriad interpretations. An
	individualist or libertarian oriented individual would argue that the
	general welfare is constituted by liberty and compromised by
	vaccination (i.e. that vaccination is only superficially for the
	general welfare). Finally, vaccination is not (nor has it ever been)
	mandatory in the United States except in limited contexts and for
	targeted demographics. This has not resulted in pandemics 'running
	wild' in the country. Nor is it self-evident that this would
	necessarily be a bad thing or against the general welfare.

					horrible little man:- DNA ancestry tests branded 'meaningless'
					Commercial DNA tests that claim to tell people whether they are

					"genetic astrology", scientists have warned. The amount of DNA any
					individual inherits from relatives just a few steps up their family
					tree is negligible compared with the vast amount we all share from

					simple genetic test is just one of dozens of possible interpretations,

					"absurd", they claimed. https://www.telegraph.co.

			It is your claim. As I already pointed out, and as you've now
			documented yourself, the preamble of the Constitution enumerates
			numerous purposes alongside promoting the general welfare.
			Consequently, the claim that "the overriding purpose of the nation is
			to promote the general welfare" is not supported by mere appeal to the
			Constitution which does not establish that purpose as overriding
			(rather, it establishes it as concurrent with and conditioned upon
			other purposes). It is, therefore, your claim. And one which you
			refuse to substantiate.

To what vaccine are you referring? When, where and by whom was this
vaccine developed? You're becoming mutinous about an imaginary
scenario which hasn't happened yet and isn't likely to for the
foreseeable future. I would be confident that if such a vaccine was
ever developed and became available to the general public you'd first

		Children are required to receive education, but they are not required
		to do so at a school (public or private). No one is forcing anyone to
		send their child to school; homeschooling is an option. If someone
		wants to send their child to a school, then there are costs to doing
		so (limited to but not including vaccination, with the notable opt out
		caveat that's already been mentioned).

		That sounds like forcing to me. Seeing that parents can opt out of

Leading with the caveat that this scenario seems unlikely, I do not
think that vaccines should be forced upon anyone. I'm not persuaded
that vaccination is, generally speaking, a desirable approach to
communicable disease in the first place. Setting that aside, though, I
am wary of giving any government any medical authority over and
against the autonomy of individuals. I am also not persuaded that such
authority is necessary for vaccination campaigns to be successful.
That said, I am not necessarily opposed to vaccinations being mandated
for students to attend public schools (or any private school or
homeschool which receives public funding), provided that attendance
itself is not compulsory. That arrangement is a transparent cost (such
as it is, which is to say generally minimal) to accepting the benefits
of attending the publicly financed institution; that informed decision
being consensual, I see no violation of autonomy.

	I'm not persuaded that vaccination is, generally speaking, a

	luckily, persuading you is not how the medical effectiveness of
	vaccines is tested. Setting that aside, though, I am wary of giving
	any government any medical authority over and against the autonomy of
	individuals. The government has always had medical authority over the
	autonomy of individuals. Try researching what went on at psychiatric

	to help you live longer and on the other we have diseases like
	smallpox, polio and bubonic plague, which wiped out or crippled
	massive portions of the human population. Whether you are "persuaded"
	or not doesn't matter in the slightest. Since people have been being
	vaccinated against these diseases, they have stopped killing huge
	numbers of people. Anti-Vaxxers are just plain dumb.

		Well, luckily, persuading you is not how the medical effectiveness of
		vaccines is tested. I am not disputing the effectiveness of vaccines.
		I am not persuaded that that effect is desirable; I don't place
		absolute or unreserved value on human life, and I think the roll of
		disease in mediating the population of any species has some value
		itself. That doesn't make me opposed to vaccination regimes, but it
		does put me on the fence (hence, 'not persuaded'). The government has
		always had medical authority over the autonomy of individuals. Try
		researching what went on at psychiatric institutions during the first
		half of the 20th century. That the government has had and continues to
		exercise medical authority over and against the autonomy of
		individuals is not an argument that it should do so. My familiarity of
		medical history, both public and private, is a significant basis for
		my distrust of government in general. Your reasoning is stupid. On one
		side we have paranoia about why the government wants to help you live
		longer and on the other we have diseases like smallpox, polio and
		bubonic plague, which wiped out or crippled massive portions of the
		human population. Whether you are "persuaded" or not doesn't matter in
		the slightest. Since people have been being vaccinated against these
		diseases, they have stopped killing huge numbers of people. Anti-
		Vaxxers are just plain dumb. I'm not an anti-vaxxer (lol). I don't
		believe vaccination is part of a government conspiracy, that
		vaccinations cause autism, or any of that rubbish. I agree that
		vaccination has reduced the number of human fatalities due to disease,
		and never contested that. I'm just not convinced that that is
		necessarily a good thing, and I'm actively dissuaded that that is
		sufficient grounds from which to mandate vaccination. I also accept
		vaccination as a pre-condition for participating in public or private
		institutions, so long as participation in those institutions is
		voluntary (and with the caveat that it is localized policy). Where
		such policies exist, I am opposed to 'opt out' loopholes because I
		believe in equality under the law (and not religious exceptionalism).
		That departs wildly from the anti-vaxxer 'position'.

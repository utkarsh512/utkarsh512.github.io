You've never felt the need to hold criminal politicians criminally
accountable before. Meaning this is just another politically motivated
call that will vanish as soon as the criminal is once again on your
side of the isle. Also, what crime do you wanna lick him up for?
Because they might have included it in his impeachment.

	Also, what crime do you wanna lick him up for? Hello again, A:
	There's too many to list here, but wearing a birds nest on his head
	is, by FAR, the WORST offense.. Truly.. He thinks you believe it's
	hair - and you probably do.. excon

		I think you may be right. That may actually be his worst offense.

			I think you may be right. That may actually be his worst offense.
			Much worse than say, sexually assaulting over 40 different women.
			Harvey? Is that you?

				Biden assaulted 41 women. Guess you now have to debate Biden's civil
				rights record.

					Biden assaulted 41 women. No he didn't. You assaulted your kids.
					That's why they hate you.

						You didn't respond on Biden's civil rights record. What, you can't
						defend all of his racist policies and passed bills? Dude!

		Lock him up!! Lock him up!! Lock him up!! This is interesting. Not
		only are you admitting Hillary was guilty of Chinagate, Benghazi and
		the Uranium One scandal, but you are now admitting that "she" is
		actually "he"... Excuse me libs. We're gonna need a penis check on
		aisle 3...

Recent projections are that by November over two hundred thousand
people will have died of the pandemic in United States. I maintain
that the vast majority of the people who die wouldn't have died had a
sane person occupied the oval office. Trump is probably the absolute
worst person in the world to occupy the White House in a national
emergency. He's far worse than incompetent. If he did absolutely
nothing but watched TV and ate KFC or golfed every day and didn't do
anything at all regarding the nations business we would be far better
off. Instead, he walks around refusing to wear a mask. He's
encouraging stupid people to not wear a mask which is the key to
ending this pandemic. If we'd had a sane President he would have come
right out of the gate and used the Defense Production Act to order
immediate mass manufacture of masks and testing kits and ventilators
ect., but he did the opposite of that. Isn't there such a thing as
criminal incompetence? If this isn't criminal incompetence, what is?

	I'm dubious that things would have been terribly better under another
	president. The United States health care infrastructure and civic
	conscience were deplorable well before Trump, and under numerous
	administrations. Trump certainly made it worse, but I'd say it's a
	stretch to put "the vast majority" of deaths at his feet. No need to
	limit stinging criticism to political figureheads either. You could
	start by putting the deaths at the feet of stupid people who don't
	wear masks, too; just because person X does something doesn't mean
	anyone else has to (i.e. they're accountable for their own acts as
	individuals). Much more comfortable to emphasize the wrongs of one
	dude than to acknowledge that people generally suck, I guess.

		"No need to limit stinging criticism to political figureheads
		either." The President is supposed to be a LEADER. He could have set a
		good example but instead he set a bad example. He didn't use the
		defense production act as any responsible LEADER would have done. He
		didn't encourage people to wear masks as any real LEADER would have
		done. Instead he kept telling everybody that the corona was going to
		simply disappear when the warm weather arrived. Anything he has done
		is all about getting himself re-elected. It's all about him because
		he's a narcissist/psychopath. I gotta wonder if you've been on a
		different planet and are completely unaware of what's been happening
		on this one.

			You have leapt rather predictably to the unsound conclusion that I
			approve of how Trump has handled things. I assure you that I do not.
			There are limits to how far any one individual's culpability can
			extend, however, including that of the POTUS. Ultimately, each person
			is still responsible for themselves and my original critique was
			against displacing that responsibility onto a political figurehead.
			Trump did not encourage people to wear masks. Trump told everyone that
			the issue would just resolve itself soon. All true. But people who do
			not wear masks and believe the issue will take care of itself did not
			have to listen to Trump. Those are decisions that they made on their
			own for which they themselves - not Trump - are accountable for. As an
			aside, the implicit notion that Trump is somehow exceptionally
			narcissistic or psychopathic relative to other POTUS is hilarious.
			This bedtime story version of politics you've got where the POTUS is a
			leader who doesn't foremost care about their own power and legacy is
			so naive.

		No need to limit stinging criticism to political figureheads either.
		You could start by putting the deaths at the feet of stupid people who
		don't wear masks, too Or people marching in New York, Chinatown, and
		celebrating Mardis Gras and having Hug a Chinese Person Day in 97
		percent Democrat cities.

			Yes, people gathering publicly for any reason are also responsible.
			The reason may be defensible from certain perspectives - getting
			groceries to feed yourself, protesting for some cause or other, having
			a social life for mental well-being, etc. - but they're still
			responsible. P.S. Bugger off with your racist dog whistle.

		I'm dubious that things would have been terribly better under another
		president. We'll need to work on that. The United States health care
		infrastructure and civic conscience were deplorable well before Trump,
		and under numerous administrations. Yeah, but Trump has added extra
		problems, like not being able to trust a word which comes out of your
		president's mouth and buying (or threatening) favors from foreign
		governments in order to influence US elections.

			We'll need to work on that. Why? Generally counting against the
			benevolence and compassion of the kind of person who can secure the
			office of POTUS to themselves is both reasonable and prudent. Yeah,
			but Trump has added extra problems, like not being able to trust a
			word which comes out of your president's mouth and buying (or
			threatening) favors from foreign governments in order to influence US
			elections. If you believe you can trust the word that comes out of any
			POTUS' mouth you are dangerously naive. Corruption is also not
			something which Trump invented. And, for the record, Trump is not my
			president (none of them are).

		"How could Trump stop liberals from taking to the streets and

		statement when we all see the news footage of the big Trump rally in
		Tulsa tomorrow with moronic cultists packed wall to wall and floor to
		ceiling with very few (if any)masks in sight. Then the news a week
		later telling about hundreds of them sick with the corona.

Lock him up!! Lock him up!! Lock him up!! We could have a debate if
you told us what for. Looks like you can't.

Now there's an unprejudiced call if ever I heard one.

okay i think i'm at the best position to speak here. i'm a gay, and
i'm not afraid or ashamed of admitting this. and my darling has served
in the army before. some nuts say we are feminine and not strong
enough to protect our country. are you IDIOTS? do you know us? many
homosexuals're very muscular and we are healthy! why cant we serve the
country? okay lemme be serious here i do think that all americans
deserve the right and duty to serve our country. we gay people are a
part of the US! we are americans! we deserve such right and duty! why
the hell some nuts have to exclude us from the military! and what is a
soldier all about? protection. so long as he can protect our country
well who the hell cares about who he is what he is. does sexual
orientation even matter? does it weaken our ability to fight? is that
even relevant? as long as we gay people are capable of protecting the
US why cant we be part of the army! ThePyg mentioned a report
suggesting 70% of military men and women are perfectly okay with gays
in the military. so when most of the americans are okay with us, what
the fuck are those foolish guys complaning about huh?

Openly serving in the military should be a right; if you want to
fight for your country, so be it. It doesn't matter what your sexual
orientation is, you're a patriot and that's a blessing.

	The word patriot is meant to represent a person that defends their
	country, i struglle to find example's of US military actions that were
	in defense of the US. I not even going to get into what it actually
	means to be patriot but lets just say i don;t beleive it to be a good
	thing. Mark Twain: "Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel"

		A patriot is someone who supports and defends their nation's freedom.
		In most American military campaigns in the past, war has been fought
		for our freedom.

			"In most American military campaigns in the past, war has been fought

			be involved in in order to preserve its freedom.

				OK, you're right. But in the eyes of the people fighting it, it's
				patriotism, and we're fighting for freedom. That's the only way the
				military can justify war. And as long as we're gonna kill for our
				"freedom" anyway, why not let homosexuals in on it too?

					". But in the eyes of the people fighting it, it's patriotism, and
					we're fighting for freedom." Thats been one of the main problems with
					all imperialists, they all beleive they are doing something good,
					whether its defense of themselves, or spreading civilisation (like the
					British and French), or spreading democracy etc. etc. "That's the only
					way the military can justify war." Have you ever read Orwell?

						I agree. But the debate here isn't over imperialism, it's over
						homosexuals in the military. And when they join up in the military,
						they obviously believe in such imperialism. That's all that matters at
						this point. And yes, I have read Orwell. 1984 is arguably my all-time
						favorite book, and his messages are timeless.

There may or may not be a problem with it, the question is on whether
the cons outweigh the pros. I have not heard of any evidence to
suggest that our military will do poorly if gays are allowed to be
open in the military. Even so, I did hear of a report saying that 70%
of military men and women are okay with gays in the military. Is that
last 30% going to make such a big fuss that we would not be able to
keep a powerful fighting force? I find it farfetch'd to say so.

			"Imagine that... Garry disputes something I say. If I said the moon

			Ah come on, thats below the belt. "As for your video... I actually
			watched it for a change... I was unimpressed to say the least." Have
			you never heard of Bill Hicks? Im quite surprised. "Maybe if anyone
			cared enough about Ireland to try to take it down and murder your
			fellow citizens you'd understand what it means to put your life on the
			line to defend your country." Actually the British cared enough about
			our country to invade us, occupy our land, change our language,
			customs, traditions, planted settlers on Irish land (of which Northern
			Ireland is todays by-product, in fact N.I isn't only place it really
			worked although it the only place it worked on a large scale but there
			a fwe towns dotted about the country that are predominantly protestant
			from those days). This went on for 800 years furing which time
			rebellion after rebellion was crushed, all in defense of dream of
			freedom, of reclaiming our national identity. So you see i understand
			what your getting at beleive i do, ive always been fond of history,
			the very first books i read seriously were old irish history books.But
			you see i don't view american as some kind of victim cause i have this
			thing on my shoulders called a brain. I see the US as they deserve to
			be seen, as imperial conquerers just like the British. "And, I mean no
			disrespect for Ireland to say the least... If the apocalypse does come
			and it's the west versus the east, Ireland will side with us and you
			will be a minority in your country." You'd be surprised.

				Ah... I see your arrogance rearing it's ugly head again. Thanks for

					sincerely doubt you are that aware of mine. "you don't blame all the
					American people but blame the elites and the government" Thats right,
					my passivity is just as much to blame as your or any other american's,
					im not going to blame somebody for being born into a system and being
					moulded by it, i couldn't justify blaming a child for loving Kim Jong-
					il when he's been indoctrinated since the day he was born, and
					likewise i can't blame any american for supporting their countries
					actions when they have undergone such similar treatment as it is much
					more sophisticated, effective, and subtle in tis machinations, and
					appeals to deep seeded darwinian impulses, and gratifies the ego-
					conciousness presenting the wolrd a fake place that looks a certain

					victims" Of course there are, there are victims everywhere, Bradley
					Manning is just one who's currently being tortured for trying to tell
					the truth about his countries atrocities in Iraq. "Can there not be
					victims on both sides?" This isn't even up for debate, this is virtual
					truism.

I don't see the point of discrimination against the gay. From my view
point it looks like they're the new African Americans. Why should
America always discriminate.

brave enough to go out, and protect their country, then they should be
able to, regardless of their sexual orientation.

There have been mANY, many successful military men who were gay. i
think one of them may be known by some historians. his name was
Alexander the Great. One of the greatest commanders in military
history! It is ashame that people who want to defend their country (*
a country btw that supports their right to be gay) and they have to
hide who they are in fear of being beaten, ostricised etc. when it
does not hamper their abilty to shoot a gun or kill an enemy!

Personally, I take a neutral position on homosexuality. As for their
ability to join the military, I am perfectly fine with an American
citizen fighting for our rights. That being said, I do not think that
they should necessarily go around revealing that they are in fact gay.
An important element of the military's success is a feeling of unity,
and we are still at a point in this country where finding out that a
soldier is gay could cause resentment within the unit. If a soldier
isn't going to give his 100% to save a fellow American (due to
homophobia), it weakens the unit overall. Each soldier needs to feel
that he or she will give their 100% to protect each and every member
of their unit, and making a statement about one's sexuality that could
cause strain is just asking for trouble IMO. I still stand by my POV
that they should be welcome in the military, however.

They're hired murderers. It doesn't matter if they're black, white,
gay, straight, asexual, whatever. If they want to run around murdering
people under the guise that they're being 'patriots', let them. I say
let women fight too, even out the idiot factor.

There isn't a problem with it, but the idea that you should announce
to the world that you are gay and military isn't necessary. Sexual
orientation shouldn't really matter at all. However, it shouldn't be
about that; one's first identity should simply be an American soldier,
not a homosexual American soldier. Also, announcing your homosexuality
may induce violence and discrimination. This shouldn't happen, but it
does. It may even be in a person's own good to simply keep this
information to themselves, because most likely there isn't going to be
a lot of gay sex happening in the army anyway.
[Posted by Troy8 at 2011-09-22T17:39:49+00:00 - Side: There's a problem with it!]

	There isn't a problem with it, but the idea that you should announce
	to the world that you are gay and military isn't necessary I don't
	think anyone is arguing that they should walk into the barracks with a
	pink feathered robe and announce "Hey! I'm gay!" The argument is
	whether or not they should be expelled if and when their sexuality
	becomes a topic of conversation. Sexual orientation shouldn't really
	matter at all. I fully concur. However, it shouldn't be about that;
	one's first identity should simply be an American soldier, not a
	homosexual American soldier. Well, yeah! THAT is their argument.
	Here's the thing: a heterosexual can hang pin-ups in their locker,
	talk about the hot chicks they banged on leave, tell stories about
	their girlfriends and wives, and not worry about losing their ability
	to serve their country with honor. Under DADT, homosexuals couldn't do
	any of tha in regards to the men they liked. When they are firing a
	bullet into the head of a terrorist, they are a soldier. But they are
	also comprised of everything that adds up to their whole, including
	who they find attractive. Also, announcing your homosexuality may
	induce violence and discrimination. You think they don't know that? In
	my opinion, one who willingly walks in to a scenario where they might
	be killed before they even SET FOOT IN ENEMY SOIL is one brave
	individual. And we need courage in our ranks, especially these days.
	ALSO, they AREN'T BEING REQUIRED TO ANNOUNCE THEIR SEXUALITY THROUGH A
	BULLHORN. All that's being asked is that if others discover that they
	are gay, that it doesn't affect their service record. It may even be
	in a person's own good to simply keep this information to themselves,
	because most likely there isn't going to be a lot of gay sex happening
	in the army anyway. Ummm, chances are, if a homosexual enters the
	armed forces, it is because they want to serve their country, not get
	laid....much like heterosexuals who enlist...

			True, which is EXACTLY why there shouldn't be an issue at all. Since

				Alright, I agree with you that sexuality has no place in military. So
				why is it necessary to declare you are a homosexual when there is
				absolutely no reason to do so unless you are some self-righteous gay
				rights advocate. But politics cannot get in the way of the military
				duties soldiers must serve. Don't ask, don't tell worked perfectly
				fine. This allows for homosexuals to serve alongside heterosexuals
				without politics, sex, or religion distracting from the ultimate goal.
				Once again, I am only on this side because obviously the issue is not
				whether homosexuals should be in the army or not, but whether one
				should share their sexual orientation one way or another.
				[Posted by Troy8 at 2011-09-25T12:07:38+00:00 - Side: There's a problem with it!]

					So why is it necessary to declare you are a homosexual when there is
					absolutely no reason to do so unless you are some self-righteous gay
					rights advocate. It isn't. And that is not what DADT opponents are
					arguing for. Just because a homosexual is allowed to serve does not
					mean they are required to be universally identified by their
					sexuality. It just means that if it becomes public knowledge, they
					wouldn't have to worry about being discharged from the military. Don't
					ask, don't tell worked perfectly fine. No it didn't. It caused many
					servicemen and servicewomen to loose their jobs over something that
					has nothing to do with their ability to serve. It caused homoesexual
					soldiers to have to lie and hide things from the people who are
					trusting them with their lives. It likely caused a lot of people who
					had the skill and desire to serve their country to not enlist in the
					first place (and in a time when we fight multiple wars on multiple
					fronts, we need all the willing and capable soldiers we can get.) It
					opened the door to blackmail. This allows for homosexuals to serve
					alongside heterosexuals without politics, sex, or religion distracting
					from the ultimate goal. Not at all. First, DADT had nothing to do with
					religion or politics. Second, it was probably very distracting to the
					homosexuals who were serving under DADT and had to constantly hide a
					big portion of their identity. But since you did bring up politics and
					religion, lets remember that people of any political persuasion or any
					religion can serve and don't have to hide it. They may choose not to
					bring it up, but their job isn't on the line over it. DADT identified
					an aspect of one's life that shouldn't be an issue and puts pretty
					high stakes on keeping it secret. Once again, I am only on this side
					because obviously the issue is not whether homosexuals should be in
					the army or not, but whether one should share their sexual orientation
					one way or another. Then you aren't really in the right debate. The
					title of the debate is "Homosexuals being in the military", and you
					are on the "There's a problem with it" side.

					Don't ask, don't tell worked perfectly fine. On average, more than 70
					people per month were discharged every month for about 16 straight
					years ( ref ) including more than 68 Arab and Farsi linguists (like
					Dan Choi )

			The sexuality isn't a part of their military career. Whilst military

						I never said they should have less rights. Obviously no one is making

						saying that we should go back to the Don't ask, Don't tell policy,
						because it eliminated any kind of military distraction in politics,
						religion, and sex.

							It was not "don't ask don't tell" for straight people. If a straight
							man let on to his buddy that he slept with a woman the night before,

				Once again, sex has no place in the military. How did heterosexual
				men serve in the army for the hundreds of years before women were also
				allowed to serve? Sex is simply a known sacrifice one makes by

			Apparently you don't think in pragmatic terms. It is not practical at
			all to think that there is no sex in the military. Even before DADT
			was repealed it had a presence. It has a presence in every aspect of
			life, period. DADT was an oppressive policy and was depriving
			individuals of their liberty, primarily freedom of speech/expression.
			By saying that DADT should be in effect, you are therefore undermining
			the constitution, the founding fathers, and what our country has stood
			for since it's formation. I agree that sexual orientation should not
			be an issue, but it is completely unrealistic (and unacceptable) to
			assume that just because it shouldn't be that we have the right to
			govern whether or not it is.

				Devil's Advocate? Serving in the military deprives those individuals
				of many other liberties as well. Due process of law is one; a court
				martial or military tribunal is rather different from the legal system
				that civilians enjoy. Freedom of speech is another; soldiers cannot
				officially speak plainly to officers without their leave, though it
				does happen from time to time. We aren't talking about civilians here,
				we are talking about soldiers. In the interest of a functional,
				organized military, with obedient soldiers and solidarity amongst the
				troops, a number of freedoms must be curtailed somewhat. Free
				expression can undermine the authority of officers and exacerbates the
				problem of soldiers forming cliques rather than forming solidarity
				amongst their own unit. Free sexuality can do much the same. Proper
				due process in terms of the military has similar problems- the many
				loopholes and appeal processes in our normal court system means the
				process is altogether too slow and lets too many people off for it to
				function properly in a military context. It's bad enough when a
				criminal gets off on a technicality; what if soldiers were doing the
				same, and we were handing them their guns back immediately? Curtailing
				freedoms- MANY freedoms- is necessary to have a functional military.
				You can't look at soldiers in the same way as you look at ordinary
				citizens because of that. I'm of the mind that DADT should be extended
				to all the various types of gender identity and sexual orientation,
				even including the baseline heterosexual male-identifying male.
				Religion and political views for that matter, as well.

I don't think gay should be allowed in the military. If gays were
allowed in the military it would cause problems. I mean I don't have a
problem if your gay. But I hate it when your flamboyant about it and
many people in the military would be too and if your not flamboyant
then why does it matter anyway? And lets be honest here, how many
times do you think a gay person will be bullied in the military.
There's a saying, if it ain't broke don't fix it, and I think that it
applies here. If your gay and you want to join the military then just
join, if want to yell out your gay and your proud of it then you just
look stupid. No one should need to know and why would you need to tell
anyone else you are? When your in the military you should only be
thinking of one thing and that is the mission at hand and if your
waiting on base then do whatever you want.

	If gays were allowed in the military it would cause problems. Dozens
	of countries now allow homosexuals to serve in the military. To best
	of my knowledge, none of them have reported any problems with
	effectiveness or morale. Israel is well known to have one of the most
	active and successful armed forces in the world. They allow gays to
	serve openly and it hasn't hampered their success in any detectable
	way. and if your not flamboyant then why does it matter anyway? It
	isn't about being flamboyant. It is about the fact that if someone
	gets outed, they loose their job. This means they have to spend the
	whole time they are in the military hiding something that is a central
	part of their lives, whereas heterosexuals can go around talking about
	their wives or past sexual conquests without worrying about their
	legal ability to serve their country. And lets be honest here, how
	many times do you think a gay person will be bullied in the military.
	They know this. If they want to serve their country despite of this,
	that is their decision to make, and shows considerable bravery and
	patriotism on their part. There's a saying, if it ain't broke don't
	fix it, and I think that it applies here. Here's some ways in which
	DADT was broken: it caused many perfectly capable men and women to
	lose their jobs over a factor that has nothing to do with their
	ability to serve. It caused many people to choose not to serve. It
	created distractions to gay servicemen who had to constantly watch
	what they do and say, even when they are on leave or at base. It
	created possibility for blackmail. No one should need to know and why
	would you need to tell anyone else you are? Then, do you think that
	all servicemen should be prohibited from mentioning any reference to
	their sexuality, including all off-duty conversations about sex or
	romance, or even the fact they are married or have girlfriends? What's
	good for the goose is good for the gander. When your in the military
	you should only be thinking of one thing and that is the mission at
	hand And why would gay men and women be incapable of this? and if your
	waiting on base then do whatever you want. Which is the problem,
	because the homosexuals in the military CAN'T do what they want on
	base. Hell, even if they are home on leave they have to watch their
	step, or what they post on Facebook, etc.

	there's a saying, if it ain't broke don't fix it I think the fact
	that the USA and it's military are finally making changes to move
	forward is a good thing. The military is a broken system what with the
	way vets are treated when they return from combat or the very low
	enrollment numbers. If there is a brave enough soul who wishes to
	stand up for his or her country, they should be allowed to do so
	without having to hide who they are. Your argument is like going back
	in time and saying that someone with a different colour skin CAN join
	in- they just have to cover their face.

	It doesn't matter if they get bullied or not! They should have the
	right to be who they are and not be forced to pretend they are someone
	other than who they really are. America was founded on the idea of
	being able to be who you are with being persecuted or punished for it!
	It's not right and it needs to be fixed period. You wouldn't say that
	if your black in the military you should have to wear a mask and skin
	coverings similar to that of a caucasian persons would you?

The uniform code of military justice states the following: Article
125—Sodomy (a) Any person subject to this chapter who engages in
unnatural carnal copulation with another person of the same or
opposite sex or with an animal is guilty of sodomy. Penetration,
however slight, is sufficient to complete the offense. (b) Any person
found guilty of sodomy shall by punished as a court-martial may
direct. Because of this, the military law has always stated that
anyone who commits an act of sodomy, whether it be anal or oral sex,
with their wife or husband is subject of arrest and dismissal from the
United States military. Either this law will have to change or the
military will have to continue to exclude homosexuals who are clearly
admitting outright they are breaking military law. Also, adultery and
fornication have traditionally been punishable offenses that sometimes
result in dishonorable discharge. Acceptance of homosexuals does not
bode well for a military that has traditionally been Biblical in its
enforcement of sexual morality.

	The uniform code of military justice states the following You will
	find the question isn't over what UCMJ currently states, but rather if
	it is justified in such codes of conduct. There is still a lot of
	discussion between military legal scholars whether article 125 should
	also be repealed. A similar law within Texas was struck down as being
	unconstitutional, legal precedence would but this article on the
	chopping block. The sexual activities between consenting adults behind
	closed doors is not for the Federal government to intrude upon.
	Because of this, The Uniform Code Of Military Justice, did not exist
	prior to 1950 the military law has always stated that anyone who
	commits an act of sodomy, whether it be anal or oral sex, with their
	wife or husband is subject of arrest and dismissal from the United
	States military Your argument effectively amounts to "It's always been
	done that way, therefore we should continue to do it that way". It's a
	tautology, that tradition is justified because it is tradition. If we
	followed this line of reasoning no social or political progress would
	have been made ever. We would still have slavery, and women would
	still not be allowed to vote, if we had followed tradition for the
	sake of following tradition. This mantra is neither intellectually nor
	socially fruitful.

I'm gay!" The argument is whether or not they should be expelled if and when their sexuality becomes a topic of conversation. Sexual orientation shouldn't really matter at all. I fully concur. However, it shouldn't be about that; one's first identity should simply be an American soldier, not a homosexual American soldier. Well, yeah! THAT is their argument. Here's the thing: a heterosexual can hang pin-ups in their locker, talk about the hot chicks they banged on leave, tell stories about their girlfriends and wives, and not worry about losing their ability to serve their country with honor. Under DADT, homosexuals couldn't do any of tha in regards to the men they liked. When they are firing a bullet into the head of a terrorist, they are a soldier. But they are also comprised of everything that adds up to their whole, including who they find attractive. Also, announcing your homosexuality may induce violence and discrimination. You think they don't know that? In my opinion, one who willingly walks in to a scenario where they might be killed before they even SET FOOT IN ENEMY SOIL is one brave individual. And we need courage in our ranks, especially these days. ALSO, they AREN'T BEING REQUIRED TO ANNOUNCE THEIR SEXUALITY THROUGH A BULLHORN. All that's being asked is that if others discover that they are gay, that it doesn't affect their service record. It may even be in a person's own good to simply keep this information to themselves, because most likely there isn't going to be a lot of gay sex happening in the army anyway. Ummm, chances are, if a homosexual enters the armed forces, it is because they want to serve their country, not get laid....much like heterosexuals who enlist...##$$##@@https://utkarsh512.github.io/pages/createdebate_2/comment_2.txt@#@#@I dont really see why its discriminating, if they are just gathering publicly available info, I dont know what they will be using the data for, but it can serve for medical prevention for example, as some races are more sensible to some kinds of deseases##$$##@@https://utkarsh512.github.io/pages/createdebate_2/comment_3.txt@#@#@I have to agree with David (Shocking...

There must be a different approach. Education, detection of violent people, information, etc, etc but providing easy access to guns is a poor way of trying to get a safe country.

PARTY PARROT i will address a few items you seem to be confused about !!!!! 1 - Trump doesn't want U.S. to see the full Mueller Report Look into the law there dummy and you will find that Grand Jury information is protected by Federal Law. Are you unable to understand fact ?????????? 2 - leasing (destroying) our National Parks to the fossil fuel cartel Paying attention is really not your thang is it AL !!!!!!!! https://www.gao.gov/key issues/oil and natural gas/issue_summary I am trying to help your BRAIN DEAD ASS out ! The Department of the Interior oversees oil and natural gas production on federal lands and waters—providing access to these resources while ensuring their safe and responsible development. Federal oil and gas resources provide an important source of energy for the United States; create jobs in the oil and gas industry; and generate billions of dollars annually in revenues that are shared between federal, state, and tribal governments. Interior reported collecting over $55 billion from fiscal years 2011 through 2016 from royalties and other payments. This makes oil and gas resources one of the federal government’s largest sources of nontax revenue. Pay close attention to FY 2011 through 2016 !!!!!!! 3 - ignoring the Earth our grandchildren will have to live in https://www.energyprofessionals.com/ states/rhode-island/ Natural Gas Natural gas fuels nearly all of Rhode Island’s electric generation and heats half of its households. Rhode Island does not have any natural gas production or reserves. The state’s natural gas is supplied almost entirely by pipeline from Connecticut, which transports natural gas received from New York, but some natural gas also arrives from Massachusetts. Almost two-thirds of the natural gas entering Rhode Island is delivered to Massachusetts. Historically, natural gas has arrived in Rhode Island from producing areas in Canada and from the U.S. Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent regions, but increasing amounts of natural gas are coming from Appalachian Shales, particularly the Marcellus Shale of Pennsylvania. Electric power generators and the residential sector are Rhode Island’s largest natural gas consumers. More than half of the natural gas consumed in the state goes to the electric power sector and almost all in-state electricity generation is fueled with natural gas. As increasing amounts of natural gas are used for electricity generation in Rhode Island, and throughout New England, assurance of natural gas supply has become a critical energy issue for the region. AL why are you CLIMATE BELIEVERS depending on a FOSSIL FUEL that you oppose ? Must be you YANKS depend on the fossil fuel cartel !!!!!!!!!! 4 - Please plan on voting intelligently, NOT conservatively.

Like brainwashed robots in a cult, you keep repeating the same lies. For the thousanths time, OBAMACARE IS COLLAPSING UNDER IT'S OWN COMPLETE FAILURE! Do facts matter to you or are you a complete phoney loser. The 20 million people added to the medicaid roles, on the backs of middle class families, was never sustainable!!!!!! It was all a temporary ponzey scheme forced on the American people to usher in their one payer Government controlled healthcare. Now, you hideous deceptive liars keep screaming how the GOP must keep these 20 million people insured EVEN THOUGH Obamacare could not keep them insured! IT IS COLLAPSING WITH THE INSURANCE COMPANIES DROPPING OUT OF THE EXCHANGES. Can you grasp the fact that if Obama stayed in office another couple years, these 20 million people would have lost their health insurance because there would be no health insurance companies left in the exchanges. HELLO!!!!!!!! No one can afford to give all these people free healthcare with all these added medical coverages of birth control, abortion, mental, vision, maternity, etc. etc. etc. Obama purposely delayed the largest increases of premiums and deductibles until after he was out of office. Why are you so deceptive? This is why you get banned. I hate deception because there is no debate with a person when he has no problem twisting the facts and deceiving others.##$$##@@https://utkarsh512.github.io/pages/createdebate_2/comment_10.txt@#@#@a good point, no one else has brought up the parents. and not wanting my opinion to be misconstrued, i would like to say that if gay marriage was accepted, and gay people themselves, i dont think that the parents would be hurt so much. i think they are mostly hurt because they dont think it is good for their kids bc society like to push that opinion.##$$##@@https://utkarsh512.github.io/pages/createdebate_2/comment_11.txt@#@#@Stopping fighting the truth Socialist Troll !

	Venezuela is poor because it only sells one commodity which is
	controlled entirely by the state. They were poor when Obama was in
	office, before the sanctions. They were the richest country in Latin
	America before Socialism. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pri.

		Venezuela is poor because it only sells one commodity which is
		controlled entirely by the state. That commodity is oil, halfwit.
		Venezuela's economy was booming until Western powers began to get
		nervous about the massive success of its social programs during the
		1970s and conspired to crash the price of oil. They were the richest
		country in Latin America before Socialism. Oh God shut the fuck up you
		utter clown. The way you lie and distort facts is embarrassing.
		Venezuela's social programs were a huge success:- The 1970s were boom
		years for oil, during which the material standard of living for all
		classes in Venezuela improved. This was partly due to the ruling AD
		and COPEI parties' investing in social welfare projects which, because
		of the government's oil income, they could do without heavily taxing
		private wealth.[3] "Venezuelan workers enjoyed the highest wages in
		Latin America and subsidies in food, health, education and
		transport."[4] However, "toward the end of the 1970s, these tendencies
		began to reverse themselves."[5] Per capita oil income and per capita
		income both declined, leading to a foreign debt crisis and forced
		devaluation of the bolivar in 1983.

			venezuela- maduro-digs-n969726 CÚCUTA, Colombia — Dozens of volunteers
			prepared sacks of rice, canned tuna and protein-rich biscuits for
			malnourished children as Venezuela's opposition vowed to deliver the
			U.S. humanitarian aid to their troubled nation. As the food and
			hygiene kits were packed into individual white bags in the city of
			Cúcuta, just across the river from Venezuela, U.S. officials and
			Venezuelan opposition leaders appealed to the military to the let the
			aid through. Lester Toledo, who is representing opposition leader Juan
			Guaidó in the aid mission, issued a message to troops, telling them
			the aid contains food and medicine their own families need. He
			recalled how in 2016, a large group of Venezuelan women dressed in
			white and intent on crossing the closed border with Colombia made
			their way through a line of national guardsmen to buy food on the
			other side. "I am convinced that the way we are going to pass this aid
			is with the Venezuelan people," Toledo said at a press event unveiling
			the aid. "People, people and more people bringing in humanitarian
			aid." The emergency supplies have become the focus of Venezuela's
			political struggle between President Nicolás Maduro and Guaidó, who
			declared interim presidential powers in late January, accusing Maduro
			of being illegitimate following an election last year widely viewed as
			a sham. The Venezuelan military has blocked the bridge where the aid
			is stationed and Maduro is refusing to allow it in. The embattled
			Venezuelan leader dug in further this week, contending the aid is part
			of a coup being orchestrated by the U.S. government.

			President Nicolas Maduro announced a new set of measures in the
			Venezuelan gold industry to combat the U.S. imposed sanctions, which
			he described as “crazy” and “criminal,” accusing the North American
			country of blocking, and raising the price of food and medicine
			imports into the country. The U.S. government announced a new set of
			sanctions against the Latin American country last week, potentially
			limiting their gold exports, as announced by the national security
			senior advisor John Bolton. The sanctions already prohibited
			institutions, business and anyone from giving any kind of financial
			support to the Bolivarian Revolution. Maduro answered Bolton’s
			comments during a televised speech, saying Venezuela is currently
			certifying 32 gold fields. “Everything suggests that Venezuela will be
			the second biggest gold reserve on planet Earth,” said the President,
			adding that the country will do what’s necessary to get around the
			restrictions that are preventing medicine and food to enter the
			country. “If we go out to purchase the required food… we end up paying
			50, 60 or 80 percent more,” said Maduro. “These are crazy,
			schizophrenic, criminal sanctions… but we will never bow down.
			Venezuela will never surrender to North American imperialism.” Maduro,
			along with his economic team, announced that Venezuela is installing
			54 gold processing plants with new technology to reportedly avoid the
			polluting use of mercury. According to their predictions, the plants
			will bring in about US $ 5 billion in 2019.

		Venezuela is poor because it only sells one commodity which is
		controlled entirely by the state. 2/3 of the economy is private and
		the rest is state run. It order for it to qualify as "socialist" there
		needs to be quite a bit of PUBLIC/COLLECTIVE ownership and there is
		literally none. They were poor when Obama was in office, before the
		sanctions. The sanctions were there before Obama. They were the
		richest country in Latin America before Socialism. They were never
		socialist, they simply had enough public programs to worry the
		capitalists enough to start economically sabotaging them.

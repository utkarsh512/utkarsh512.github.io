I don't know much about this, but philosophically I'd say you can
either defend collecting ALL data of that kind, or, NONE of the data
of that kind. Meaning if you are collecting Asian heritage data then
you need to get everyone else's heritage data as long as it falls into
a substantial and recognizable group. And, if you are specifically NOT
collecting Asian heritage data then you also shouldn't be collecting
Black, White, Hispanic, whatever.

	Grenache, I agree. My tendency is toward not gathering heritage data
	at all for two reasons. 1-It is cheaper not to gather and process it
	all. 2-The data is not useful in creating better public policy because
	race/family origin are red herrings.

This is obviously discrimination against Asian-Americans,just as
others words “Why single out Asians? If the goal is better
policymaking, why not collect data on all ethnic groups?”

	I dont really see why its discriminating, if they are just gathering
	publicly available info, I dont know what they will be using the data
	for, but it can serve for medical prevention for example, as some
	races are more sensible to some kinds of deseases

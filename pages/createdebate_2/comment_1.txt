		Yeah.. But, the Brits didn't have Apache Helicopters. America does..
		Apache helicopters piloted by patriots with no interest in going
		around killing other patriots. They'd sooner turn them on their
		commander than on their mother. Or were you meaning pilots who are
		Communist Democrats? If it's a real bitch to control Afghanistan,
		imagine trying to control gangs and patriots who are fortified and in
		much bigger numbers. Maybe they'll recruit the snowflakes who are
		afraid to even see a gun.

			absurd hypocrite. Not ten hours ago you were arguing that you need
			guns because the government could send the military after you. Can you
			even stick to the same line of bullshit for longer than a few hours at
			a time, you insane little twerp?

		Aah. The ol' "roll over and play dead" strategy. Yes, yes. You know
		what I say Con? If they don't kill us from above, they gotta come down
		for fuel. Good luck post landing.

American reaction to being told to surrender their weapons has been
pretty consistent throughout history' From 1776 to Bastogne,( Nuts),
the Yanks have always displayed defiance in the face of such arrogant
demands.

	American reaction to being told to surrender their weapons has been

	innocent people with those weapons, including hundreds of thousands of
	children, has also been fairly consistent throughout history.

		Americans only ever killed those who needed killing. Your feeble
		attempt at trying to pluck the the heart strings by referring to
		hundreds of thousands of children is embarrassingly transparent. No
		matter where you're from or what your political persuasion is, you
		have to thank the United Stares of America for your liberty and
		freedom to print your sanctimonious drivel. Like THE FROGS whose
		president recently insulted it's greatest ally by provocatively
		declaring that Europe should form an Army to counter threats from
		China, Russia and THE UNITED STATES , you have a short memory and a
		shallow mindset.

			Americans only ever killed those who needed killing. Ahahahaha!
			Documented civilian deaths from violence: 182,522 – 204,885
			https://www.iraqbodycount.org/ Your feeble attempt at trying to pluck
			the the heart strings by referring to hundreds of thousands of
			children is embarrassingly transparent. Your refusal to acknowledge
			the hundreds of thousands of innocent victims of guns betrays you as a
			narcissistic psychopath.

		Dummy can you quote for us the ignorance you speak of ????????????

		That so true, look at the Native Americans who didn't have guns and
		were slaughtered by those who did. If you don't have the weapons to
		match your adversary you too will be part of that statistic. innocent
		people killed by guns. Yet if you too have a gun your chances of being
		attacked and killed drop to less than half. It's never a good thing to
		leave yourself defenseless by giving up your only means of protection
		(your Guns)

I have my money on Sanders.

Sanders is going to take this by STORM. He is going to surprise
Hillary and she will be stunned and never recover.

	I think it will be close in Iowa and a run away in New Hampshire.

		Judging from the current results, it looks like you are correct!

			On to New Hampshire.

Sanders is who I'd vote for if I was 18+..... The third guy had like,
no votes for either party.

I hate Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders all the way. Feel the Bern.

Tough call. I'd say Hillary, since Sanders has spoken out against the
institution of the Iowa caucus. Iowa has, historically, been pretty
touchy about two things: Their electoral position, and ethanol
subsidies.

Hillary will win by 5 percent. The middle class can't be that stupid
in Iowa and want all their money to go to Bernie so he can do as he
pleases with it. Go Hillary. The lesser of two evils, by far.

	Hillary is a criminal. But many seem to not realize that.

		Out of curiosity, are you referring to the email scandal?

			Email scandal, Benghazi, etc... FEEL THE BERN

				Don't get me wrong, I don't support her, I'm just failing to see the
				criminality. The email scandal has yet to lead to any criminal
				allegations and has precedent from past individuals in her position.
				The Benghazi panel found some incompetence (no more than past people
				in her position, which seems to say a lot about who we put into these
				positions), but no criminality. Again, I'm not a fan of Hillary and
				Sanders has been one of my favorite U.S. politicians for a long time,
				so I'm not trying to indicate support for her, just curios about the
				claims.

		She is indeed and continues to lie about it, too. She's showed a
		reckless disregard for the security of sensitive information and
		claims it was "allowed", but never says who allowed it. She has to win
		the presidency to avoid going to jail.

	Hillary wants to give free college to everyone. Sanders won't
	outspend Hillary.

If Hillary wins (and Trump wins) then there will be a good chance
that during a debate Trump will utter the words, "Calm your tits,
Hillary!"

I thought the Democrats were stupid but they have reached a new level
of stupidity.

It's perceived as a sort of a trade off by the intellectually
challenged Dems. This process may, or may not ( I don't know) kill the
covid-19 virus but it dissolves the skin leaving the guinea pig a
walking human skeleton frame.

	You mean, like, many Chinamen ?????????????????????????????

		Oh my Socialist the 19 should control your life but that shows what a
		Perfect Party Parrot you are because the government has more of a
		brain than you do. No need to guess that is true your transparent
		stupid ass types it.

Nah. I don't know any democrats that would think of such a thing ….
even if the President of the United States ORDERED IT! (If we had a
President of the United States that many would listen to ;-) This
"IMPOTUS" is firing up his base, sending them to the streets :-( some
with their KIDS) and, of course, with their guns. I didn't see a
Democrat among'em, by the way …., he want's to open up things his
"base" will flock to, totally against the advice of the medical
professionals, and YOU call U.S. dummies?? I wonder how many votes
he'll lose to the virus?? Couldn't happen to a dumber … basket of
deplorables …. for want of a better name ……. ;-)

	Socialist you dummies are scared of EverClear ? How stupid are you
	dummies ?
	[Posted by Chinaman at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

		Nah. I'm not "scared" of it, I've had it a few times, but when we
		have good Bourbon around, WHY would ANYONE drink Everclear?? Speaking
		to you in Chinese I would say: "I've had me some "Tennessee Spring
		Water" that was "Clear", and REALLY nice …. if you didn't imbibe too
		heavily to where you couldn't enjoy it ;-). Now THAT was some
		"Everclear" I'd like to get me some more of. I'd REALLY be stupid to
		NOT want me some! Now, back to English. ;-)

				You should help Don with his experiment. He has a "natural ability"
				at this because his uncle was a "great super-genius".
				https://twitter.com/ddiamond/status/ 1236059773231079430?lang=en You
				should just trust him - sit under some high power UV lights, stick a
				flashlight up your ass or "some other way", then get yourself a
				cleaning injection of that disinfectant. There is some glaring
				stupidity around - that's for sure. You volunteering to test it out??

				[Posted by JustIgnoreMe at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

					Don't think for yourself there JIM get your thoughts from government
					and that shows your political leanings and i hope it works out for ya
					but your bitichin will never end.

					Only the Weak Minded buy into DNC Media and any media that feeds the
					feeble minded control your mind and as that is proven you and likes of
					you show how weak you people are and no need for me to make that up
					because it is just to easy to read and expose.
					[Posted by Chinaman at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	If it were not for the Russians then Hillary would be your POTUS and
	then you could be happy for about 30 minutes before you started
	bitchin again.

Democrats how much bleach have you decided to ingest today ? Is it a
double cap full ?
[Posted by Chinaman at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

It amazes me how stupid the Left/MSM thinks people are to suggest
that Trump was referring to lysol, bleach, etc., and feel they have to
warn the public. They have so little regard for the public and their
viewers.
[Posted by HighFalutin at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	Amazing that when someone says disinfectant, people think of the most
	popular disinfectants... The company that makes Lysol made the warning
	- not just the big scary "left" He thought it was a good idea to see
	if we could inject disinfectants into people - if you don't know that,
	you are out of touch with reality. Even Trump changed the story to him
	asking sarcastic questions of reporters once people told him how dumb
	the whole thing was.
	[Posted by JustIgnoreMe at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

		Lysol can do what they want; it's free advertisement for them by the
		MSM/Left. If Trump had used the word sterilize, the left/msm would
		have said he wanted to neuter and spay the public.
		[Posted by HighFalutin at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

			by the MSM/Left Can you explain to us why you believe vast, powerful
			business enterprises such as the MSM would be on the left?
			[Posted by BurritoLunch at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

				Because they are. All you have to do is watch and read the networks
				and news rags to know that. Read below, Eskimo: Media Bias There are
				tons of other sources, just google it yourself.
				[Posted by HighFalutin at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

					Because they are. Great. Well in that case you're a rapist because
					you are. Read below, Eskimo: Research the sources you link you
					ridiculously stupid bastard:- Overall, we rate Media Research Center
					strongly right biased based on advocacy for a conservative agenda and
					Mixed for factual reporting due to promotion of propaganda,
					pseudoscience as well as a poor fact check record by their primary
					sources https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ media-research-center-mrc/
					[Posted by BurritoLunch at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

						You dipshit. mediabiasfactcheck is a liberal source used to hoodwink
						fools like you. Nice try, not even close and no cigar for you. Check
						out their take on CNN, MSNBC and Fox and guess which one they claim
						are the conspiracist, but omit CNN/MSNBC and the Russian collusion
						hoax. It is a fact that mediabias is biased. What a dickweed!

							You dipshit. mediabiasfactcheck is a liberal source used to hoodwink
							fools like you. Ahahahahahahaha! Yes buddy, everything which exposes
							the factual inaccuracy of your Nazi propaganda is therefore liberally
							biased. Only your Nazi propaganda is real and accurate. Only your Nazi
							propaganda can be trusted. The world has heard this all before buddy.
							From pieces of shit just like you.

								Everybody's a nazi; it that all you got, lame brain?

								[Posted by HighFalutin at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

							It is a fact that mediabias is biased. The literal job of
							MediaBiasFactCheck is to analyse the media for bias, on both the right
							and left. You are more stupid than I can possibly explain in words.

								If you can't grasp the fact that mediabiasfactcheck is liberally
								biased, your IQ doesn't even rival a bucket of chum.

			If his speech was given in the context of a report about neutering
			animals and he said he looked at the neutering information and thinks
			we should do that for humans, you would say he meant using neuter
			nouns for people. You are deliberately ignoring the context. He said
			we should look at injecting disinfectants in a speech about the
			effectiveness of disinfectants like bleach and alcohol.
			[Posted by JustIgnoreMe at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	It amazes me how stupid the Left/MSM thinks people are Are you
	kidding right now? It amazes me that you think people who voted for
	Trump aren't stupid. Why would anybody else vote for a pathological
	liar who has a long, illustrious record of sexually assaulting women?
	[Posted by BurritoLunch at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

		So says a supporter of Bill and Hillary Clinton. Add Joe Biden to
		that as well. ---------------------------------------
		--------------------------------------- ------
		[Posted by HighFalutin at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

			So says a supporter of Bill and Hillary Clinton. I don't support
			either of those people you atrocious liar. I'm not even American, let
			alone a mainstream liberal. You are just a lying piece of shit and
			that is the factual reality of matters. When somebody points out that
			you or Trump are liars, the very first thing you do is point the
			finger somewhere else. That is the psychology of criminality and/or
			abuse.
			[Posted by BurritoLunch at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

				I'm not even American, let alone a mainstream liberal. You are a
				carbon-based lifeform of unknown origin. You were sent here to
				regurgitate vile and odious Trump hatred on this site in hopes of
				winning converts. You have failed miserably in that regard, you gelded
				cuck, just like you have failed to launch out of your mommy's
				basement. So, Basement Boy, isn't it time you man-up and leave your
				mommyfied existence and become something that contributes something to
				society?
				[Posted by HighFalutin at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

					You are a carbon-based lifeform of unknown origin. Therefore I
					support Bill and Hillary Clinton? Lol. You need psychiatric help mate.

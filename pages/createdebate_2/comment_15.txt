Does Iran have a vibrant westernized middle class? Yes. Like the
Chinese they tend to send a lot of their best and brightest to western
universities. I've actually met a few Iranians educated in Britain. I
remember one in particular I had a long chat with when I was working
at a local radio station. Really clever chap and very politically
aware. A lot more so than your average American, I might add.

						It literally says this in the article you just posted: "Nazi race-
						based antisemitism and nationalism did not resonate with Iranian
						audiences", ... and so, the Germans decided to deceivingly adopt pro-
						Islamic propaganda in Iran in order to win over the populace (in
						reality, Hitler had the utmost disdain for Muslims, especially the
						black haired, brown eyed varieties of Iran, India, Pakistan and Iraq).
						And it continues: "Among the themes of German propaganda was the
						notion that Hitler was the Shiite Messiah", But: "Such efforts by the
						Germans to engage the Shi’ia population prompted concerns on the part
						of the newly crowned Muhammad Reza Pahlavi, because he perceived his
						more secular-oriented regime was being undermined". It continues:
						"Iranian Jews ruled by Reza Shah and later his son, Muhammad Reza
						Pahlavi, enjoyed many rights and freedoms that they had not previously
						experienced, including relative cultural and religious autonomy,
						increased economic opportunities, and significant political rights.
						Jews also benefitted from the Pahlavi tilt towards a more secular
						domestic policy. The Iranian government informed the Germans that it
						considered Iranian Jews to be fully assimilated Iranians " And: "Many
						Polish Jews among the 116,000 Polish refugees permitted in 1942 to
						leave the Soviet interior to which they had fled in 1941 or been
						deported in 1939–1940 passed safely through Iran on the way to
						Palestine or Great Britain". And also: "Reza Shah declared Iran
						neutral at the start of World War II" And most poignantly: "On
						September 11, 1941, British Envoy Sir Reader S. Bullard met with
						Iran’s Prime Minister, Mohammad-Ali Furuqi, to demand the immediate
						removal of Reza Shah in favor of his son, Muhammad Reza Pahlavi, who
						was known to be pro-British. Five days later, on September 16, Reza
						Shah abdicated and went into exile, leaving his son as Shah. Reza Shah
						died in Johannesburg, South Africa, on July 26, 1944." CONCLUSION.
						Iran was a fucking neutral state, besieged by British and Soviet
						interests, subject to Nazi propaganda, with a leader who was
						vehemently secular and NEUTRAL. HE gave Jews unparalleled rights in
						Iran, and refused to expel either German nationals or Jews of various
						nationalities. UNTIL, the British forced him into exile and installed
						his pro British son. Which part of ANY of that leads you to conclude
						Iranians are Muslim extremist, fundamentalist Nazi lovers?? Fucking
						moron. ANd this is all from YOUR OWN ARTICLE, FROM THE FUCKING
						HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL MUSEUM! THE FUCKING JEWS WHO RUN THIS ORGANIZATION
						LITERALLY HAVE WRITTEN AN ENTIRE HISTORY THAT GOES AGAINST YOUR
						BULLSHIT, and you quoted it, in support of your bullshit. WOW. Moron.
						Fucking Moron.

								Yes, Bront. The iraninan leader decided the German propaganda bollox
								was harmful to a neutral, secular regime, and so he decided to tell
								the Germans: "Hey Germans, Jews are fully integrated Iranian citizens,
								and I'm giving them safe passage to Russia and the UK". What part of
								that is fucking difficult for you? READ THE ARTICLE!!!

										Bront, you're taking an entire historic precedent of Iran being a
										neutral nation, ruled by secularism, having taken hundreds of
										thousands of Jews into their country and treating them as equal
										citizens, and choosing a few words that might indicate that some
										Iranians believed GERMAN PROPAGANDA (you know the meaning of
										propaganda, right?) What was the outcome? Did the Iranians build
										concentration camps for Jews? no. Did the Iranians fight for the
										Germans? No. Did the Iranians convert to Nazi ideology as a
										state/country? No. Did the Iranians support the Germans in their
										military campaigns? No. Did the Iranians end up with the Allies? YES!

Yes, absolutely. They have also one of the youngest populations on
Earth, and the vast, vast, majority are heavily opposed to what
Americans seem to think they support. Few of them have any desire for
war; for conflict; for aggression; for strict fundamentalist Islam.
Women can drive. The vast majority do not wear facial coverings. Women
are more educated than men. Women can travel freely (to the extent
that other countries will grant them visas). Women can own property.
Women can work. Women can earn a wage. Women can divorce. Women can be
in public alone. Women can marry those whom they chose. By contrast,
Saudi women can do none of those things. And yet, the US government
just LOVE the Saudis (which is really quite ridiculous: Saudis had
more to do with 9/11 than Iranians did: by which I mean, NO Iranan
person was even involved!) Iranians are NOT fundamentalist, crazy,
strict, backwards Sunni Muslim Arabs. They are progressive, young,
vibrant, educated, driven, ambitious, reformist, Shi'a PERSIANS. And
most of that young generation don't even practice their religions.
PERSIANS ARE NOT ARABS.

	Absolute rubbish! It's their leaders that control their nation and
	terror. If these so called Progressive Iranian citizens have no say in
	their leaders, who cares what they believe? If they do have a say in
	their leaders, they elect leaders who scream DEATH TO ISRAEL! You
	should go live there if you think it is so great. They are State
	sponsors of terror. I guess you would call it Progressive terror. Kind
	of like Progressive No Restriction abortions in America. Humanity
	needs none of their so called Progress.

				Factually, FromWithin, Iran have not committed an act of international

				contrast, the US is, statistically, factually, the most militarily
				belligerent nation on Earth. They have literally caused the death of
				MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS more people throughout the world than the
				Iranians have, in the last century. Was it not Israel who have, on
				several occasions, bombed Iranian territory and infrastructure? As I
				remember it, they bombed a fucking French owned and operated nuclear
				energy reactor, potentially causing massive casualties and billions in
				damage. Who are the dangers to world peace, in that picture??

							SEAN B who wants to visit LONDON ?????????? Concerned at the level of
							knife violence in the country, with a significant portion of that
							coming from domestic abuse-related stabbings, British authorities have
							come up with a “violence prevention” program where sharp knives are
							swapped out for dull knives. Anyone who has been threatened at knife-
							point at home will get these special “no point knives” courtesy of the
							Nottinghamshire Police. According to authorities, the pilot anti-knife
							program will hopefully reduce knife-related violence, reported the
							Independent. A Nottinghamshire Police supervisor said, “We do see a
							fair amount of knife-related incidents in domestic abuse, not just on
							the streets. This is a measure we need to take. We want to reduce that
							risk. It is a trial. We have about 100 of them – and we have so far
							given out about 50. The knife is blunt at the end – but still
							functions as a knife – so you can’t stab someone.”

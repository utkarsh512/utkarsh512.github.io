Our "President" (the one with the very large brain … ), believes it
will turn around and that WE have nothing to do with it. The
Battleship Missouri is a very large ship, but, if we don't use it,
NOW, it isn't worth much!

There have been 5 proven ice ages in the last 500,000 years. That's
an ice age every 100,000 years. So, if we shut down all industry and
pollution on the planet, how do you plan on stopping the next one? And
if you did stop it, would the stoppage of the cycle destroy the Earth?

	So, if we shut down all industry and pollution on the planet, how do
	you plan on stopping the next one? Hello bront: Ahhh… I KNEW you were
	out there.. Look.. If I thought that some government program would END
	my lifestyle, I'd FIGHT it too... But, I believe we can fix climate
	change and SOLVE another life altering problem at the same time...
	Forget global warming for a minute.. FORGET IT.. Think about running
	out of oil instead.. Clearly, we're gonna run out, and we don't need
	no stinkin scientist to tell us that.. Truly, IF we run out, and have
	NO replacement, it's gonna ruin our lifestyle just as much as shutting
	down industry would.. So, we need to solve the running out of oil
	problem.. The time to do it is NOW.. Waiting till gas is $1,500/gal is
	TOO late.. I propose a Manhattan Project level of endeavor.. We have
	nothing to lose and everything to gain by it.. As an optimist, I
	BELIEVE we can find it. If we can't, I'd rather go down fighting than
	giving up.. Wouldn't you?? And, here's the bonus.. SOLVING the running
	out of oil problem will automatically SOLVE the global warming problem

		Think about running out of oil instead.. Right con. We'll go to pump
		it out at rates enough to fuel the Death Srar, and the libs will
		squeel about vlimate change, then circle back to don't have enough
		oil, cycle back to climate change to block drilling, rinse, wash
		repeat...

		So, we need to solve the running out of oil problem Tell the libs to
		stop blocking drilling. Pretty simple isn't it? As an optimist, I
		BELIEVE we can find it. We already know where it is.

		There have been 5 proven ice ages and 5 extreme warming periods in the

Why an ice age occurs every 100,000 years: Climate and feedback
effects explained Ice ages and warm periods have alternated fairly
regularly in Earth's history: Earth's climate cools roughly every
100,000 years, with vast areas of North America, Europe and Asia being
buried under thick ice sheets. Eventually, the pendulum swings back:
it gets warmer and the ice masses melt. While geologists and climate
physicists found solid evidence of this 100,000-year cycle in glacial
moraines, marine sediments and arctic ice, they are unable to find a
plausible explanation for it. https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/

No. But it does require adjusting how we get our energy and what we
do to our food sources. If anything it requires us to evolve more.

	Jewel can you explain this ? How is it America can make it without
	oil ! You can't because you need tires on your car or your bike !

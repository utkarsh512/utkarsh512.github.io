Spin out and give up whatever insane response u got !!!!!!!!##$$##@@https://utkarsh512.github.io/pages/createdebate_4/comment_1.txt@#@#@I also don't think that the government should be involved with out cyber problems because what if they start to go into all of our things then take from us. We cant do anything about it because who would we tell? They would have an advantage over us because we wouldn't know how to react to it all. If they can protect us and leave it be like that I would be totally with the bill. But if they end up using it agents us what would we do.##$$##@@https://utkarsh512.github.io/pages/createdebate_4/comment_2.txt@#@#@Like I said I'm a little more conservative in some areas. but the Republican Party is just as bad as the democrats and the libertarian party is the only one big enough to challenge them (maybe not now but they are getting their) so they are our only hope that's why I support them.##$$##@@https://utkarsh512.github.io/pages/createdebate_4/comment_3.txt@#@#@Its generally wrong in a moral sense.

I have aways believed in healthcare rights. It's so strange that a lot of prolifers demand the mother give her body as healthcare for her baby, but don't care about people like me, who would die without state healthcare.

Why are flu sufferers NOT getting free treatment? Dummy you continue to show that you are Socialist. Walgreens now has flu shots available in all of its pharmacies and Healthcare Clinics, including Duane Reade pharmacies and Walgreens-owned Rite Aid pharmacies. Walgreens offers free flu shots with most insurance. Flu shots are available during pharmacy and clinic hours, seven days a week—no appointment necessary.

Do I think my leaders suck? Of course, but that's a problem with all governments that decide to try to change the world" I find myself straining to come with adequate responses to what i consider your incredible ignorance and naiveté :( "and I'm not just going to take your side " This isn't about taking sides this is and what isn't true. "some dude who thinks that America is the Great Satan and the terrorists are just poor farmers who are a result of all the Great Satan's works" I don't view america as the great satan, but i acknowledge a simple truth that you seem incapable because of nationalism to acknowledge. Amerca has caused the deaths of more innocent civilians than any other nation on earth in recent times, now you can come with whatever clever rationalisaiton you like to justify that barbarism but in the real world that makes the US the greatest terrorist nation on earth. BTW i don't consider Islamic extremists poor farmers, the fact that you have to resort to ridiculing me by twisting my views really only proves my point for me. "The world is fucked, not just the US." I agree wholeheartedly with this, the world of full of bad guys, but if you're capable of calling a spade a spade then you'll realise there is a "biggest bad guy" at any particular time, and in this narrow slice of history that title rightly goes to the US##$$##@@https://utkarsh512.github.io/pages/createdebate_4/comment_10.txt@#@#@I know, i have a best friend whose parents were not as bad as THAT, but he was pretty indoctrinated it tookk me years to open up his mind lol, well he opened it up of his own accord but i think i helped him...

Not only that but, visually, I think his image would not be a net positive for America considering we are already viewed as one of the most obese nations in the world (thanks Mexico for taking the crown). Not saying I think his weight should be anyone's business in his private life, but I think when it comes to Presidential politics these things need to be considered.##$$##@@https://utkarsh512.github.io/pages/createdebate_4/comment_14.txt@#@#@You dumb ass idiot can you vote for the Royal Family ?

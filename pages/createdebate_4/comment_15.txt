Comments:

I originally was VERY opposed to the idea. I do like it, especially
for large countries, because it then forces the government to make
voting accessible. That is with proximity, convenience, voter ID, etc.
It ensures everyone has a fair chance to cast their vote. You can
still spoil the ballot. You could even wipe your ass with it, but you
gotta show up. If the government is going to make sure that your voice
can be heard, I think it is a reasonable request to have you show up.
You gotta show up for Jury Duty as a "civli requirement". why not
voting?

I definitely think it should be mandatory - people can still show
their disaproval by voting blanks.

	I definitely think it should be mandatory - people can still show
	their disaproval by voting blanks. I think it is ironic if people have
	to be forced by the state to participate in a system which is supposed
	to be democratic. If improvements could be made to the lives of
	disenfranchised voters simply by voting, then don't you expect that
	they would be doing it already? To simply force people to vote ignores
	the root of the problem and tries the suppress the symptom. People
	have nothing to gain by not voting, so the only real explanation is
	that many of them feel they have nothing to gain by voting either.

		I don't see how it ignores the root of the problem. On the contrary,
		if voting is mandatory, it is far less likely that populations will be
		marginalized. It is a huge problem in the US. Sure there are other
		things that might be able to be done. I do not think it is a fair
		argument to say, because it does not deal with the core issue, it
		therefore should not be done. Perhaps addressing the core issue iasa
		combination of multiple factors.

			I don't see how it ignores the root of the problem. It ignores the
			root of the problem because these people are not participating for
			reasons which need to be analysed and understood before an intelligent
			decision can be made about how to solve the problem. You are proposing
			that we turn a blind eye to these reasons in favour of using force,
			and that is a proposition which relies on the extremely dangerous
			assumption that the system is perfect, but these people are flawed and
			need to be forced to participate in it. It is considerably more
			probable that the system is flawed, and these people are not
			participating because it is not benefiting them. The point of the
			system is to serve the people, but it seems like in modernity most
			have been convinced that it works the other way around: that people
			are here to serve the system, and that if you don't want to
			participate there is de facto something wrong with you and you need to
			be assimilated by the Borg.

				With all due respect I did say that combating voter apathy would be a
				combination of factors. I never said turn a blind eye. I said the
				opposite. Making voting mandatory is not an assumption that voting is
				perfect. It is a way to ensure you are getting the information you
				need from the public. We do it for census, we do it for taxes, we do
				it for jury duty. We can't we do it for voting. I also said you can
				spoil your ballot, (wipe your ass with it would spoil it) One of the
				main reasons for the French Revolution, and the establishment of the
				Russian parliament, was the margenizlsed citizens did not feel they
				had a voice. Ensuring the government provides the resources to get the
				opinion of the people (a vote) is a start. Making it mandatory forces
				the resources be made available. Voter apathy is studied extensively
				and the reasons vary based on the country and the political system.
				This is not about assimilation by any means.

		I agree, I mean if you look at countries witn 70-80+ voter outcome,
		they don't force their voters to show up. I think one common factor
		between some of the countries I can think of (nordic countries
		primarily) is that they have a parliamentarian system - which is far
		more simple to understand than for example the US legal system. I
		think the simplicity gives everyone a chance to understand. Because if
		you don't understand your governmental system, it's easy to not care
		about it.

Yes, with the option of "no candidate chosen". And if a majority
don't choose a candidate, the election runs again, until they do.

	You could wipe your ass with the ballot, Piss on it, and tear it up
	if you want. Just do something.

		Isn't that pretty much, not choosing a candidate? Pretty sure there
		is nobody called "torn up piss paper" running for election. And are
		you suggesting that people ought to just choose a candidate, even if
		they don't believe in them? How about no.

Absolutely no goddamned way. I have never voted in my life. The
political system is a joke. Two candidates, both chosen and funded by
private wealth. That isn't choice. That's the opposite of choice
dressed up to look like choice. I see the political system as being
nothing more than a guardian against change. Everything stays the same
and the people who are really in charge (which certainly isn't the
government) get to pretend you've got this really special democratic
system which is fair, just and revolutionary.

	There are many other political systems, and not just the two party
	system If you had more choice would you vote?

		There are many other political systems, and not just the two party
		system That's exactly my point. Have you ever been given an
		opportunity to choose anything else? Or are you simply expected to
		accept what is there already? What power does these days is not to
		outright restrict your decisions, but rather to restrict the
		parameters of those decisions. You can have a choice, but only if we
		choose what the options are, so to speak.

			I have lived in 4 different countries, and am a citizen in two. I
			have voted in two different countries. I am not a US citizen, so I
			have never had the pleasure of being faced with a two party system.
			While on the one side you not wanting to participate appears counter
			intuitive, on the other side I get how it is not your fight to solve.
			Thank you for your perspective.

				Yeah, I don't have any experience with the US either, but I'm British,
				and it's a very similar system over here. Most developed states I
				think run a two party system, if not in name then at least in
				practice. While on the one side you not wanting to participate appears
				counter intuitive, on the other side I get how it is not your fight to
				solve. It basically comes down to this: I'm not naive enough to play
				somebody else's game and think I can win at it. If I thought for a
				moment that the political system was genuinely democratic I would feel
				exactly the same way as you, but unfortunately I don't.

							The Irish election system is proportional representation, done in a
							very unique way. Allows for a large umber of independents.

		Once politicians become successful inside the current system, their
		priority becomes maintaining the system in which they are powerful.
		Hence, even when revolutionaries do manage to cut through (like
		Sanders for example), they usually are conspired against by other
		politicians who are frightened to death that their own status and
		power will be threatened by the new ideas.

			For years he trashed the mass migration as being allowed by corporate
			interests for cheap labor which drives down wages for the little guy.
			Now he's ready to wave in the cheap labor the corporate interests
			need, and coincidentally right about the time he has become a new
			millionaire. Hey look, video of Bernie before he was bought off.

		And yet you slobbered over Corbyn for months like pavlov's dog.
		Corbyn and Sanders both prove the point, dimwit. Corbyn has been under
		constant attack from all possible directions ever since he won the
		Labour leadership. He's faced two votes of no confidence from
		dissidents within his own party and won both of them. He's been under
		bombardment from the right wing establishment press for the last three
		years, and he was the victim of a right wing plot to smear him as an
		anti-Semite (their/your favourite tactic of all). Sanders was also
		betrayed by his own party, which panicked at the fact he was serious
		about helping fix the system, and decided they'd sooner give the
		nomination to a woman who gets paid thousands of dollars to speak at
		Goldman Sachs conferences.

			Corbyn and Sanders both prove the point, dimwit. They both support

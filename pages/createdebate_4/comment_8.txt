It is exactly what they want. The best possible thing for IS is for
the Western world to alienate non-radical Muslims. Once we tell them
they do not belong, and that we consider them all to be the same, then
they will start to feel increasingly marginalized. Marginalized,
alienated people are more likely to be pushed into extremism, and then
boom, the IS starts getting more recruits. It's like the Right learned
nothing from our response to Al-Qaeda.

ISIS said in their video that they want the western countries to not
allow Muslims into their country so that Muslims will have no choice
but to join ISIS.

	The Republicans played right into Al-Qaeda's goals the first time we
	went down this road, not sure why anyone would expect them to do
	differently with IS.

Is the argument that we are playing into the terrorist's plans? Well
that could be true either way. Allowing a flood of refugees without a
reasonable screening process makes terrorist infiltration easy. If
ISIS is truly clinging to the hope that Muslim refugees will turn on
countries that don't let them in and join a terrorist organization and
do unto others the despicable things that were done unto them, then
the aforementioned hypothetical refugees must be pretty weak in their
moral convictions, and I would be glad that we didn't readily let
people who are so easily swayed into the country. I don't know that
anyone is making the argument that we should never aide refugees, but
especially given recent events, there is a practical need for some
caution when bringing in refugees from an area with a high
concentration of ISIS militants, lest we readily invite some wolves in
sheep's clothing. The perfect time for an infiltration is in the chaos
and confusion of a refugee crisis. Ask any military commander.

	Allowing a flood of refugees without a reasonable screening process
	makes terrorist infiltration easy. Except we aren't doing that. If

	the aforementioned hypothetical refugees must be pretty weak in their

	people who are so easily swayed into the country. That isn't what they
	hope. They hope that we will alienate and ostracize people in a state
	of true desperation, and that in doing so they will become
	progressively radicalized. That is what has happened time and time and
	time and time again. That is simply history. I don't know that anyone
	is making the argument that we should never aide refugees, There are
	plenty of people who have been saying "Take care of our own". but
	especially given recent events, there is a practical need for some
	caution when bringing in refugees Recent events? You mean the Paris
	attack, which was not done by any refugees from the Middle East? from
	an area with a high concentration of ISIS militants, lest we readily
	invite some wolves in sheep's clothing. The perfect time for an
	infiltration is in the chaos and confusion of a refugee crisis. Ask
	any military commander. If they wanted to get in, there are DOZENS of
	other methods they could use. There are plenty of other vetting
	processes that are far less strict, such as applying as a foreign
	student. The idea that they would use the strictest vetting process
	the United States has ever created in order to get in when there are
	easier methods is utterly illogical.

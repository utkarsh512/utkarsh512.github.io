This is a problem of private insurance being greedy fucks, not
democrats for trying to get them to comply with some common sense
provisions. For profit healthcare is a scam. Scrap obamacare and lets
do a medicare for all single payer system.

	So what you are saying is medicare for all. Okay, I can only
	interpret that as meaning EVERYONE must pay into it. So you must be in
	favor of discarding Medicaid, since Medicare is a system everyone pays
	into to. How are you going to get the dead beats to contribute to
	their health care? If they are not going to contribute, then they do
	not receive health care? I can go along with this part! Medicare for
	all, medicaid for no one.

		Progressive taxation. The rich pay more the poor pay less. The same
		way it works in private insurance really. Also this idea of "dead
		beats" and "welfare queens" is an utter myth. The majority of people
		on food stamps are working. Many even have 2 jobs. This is a problem
		of them not generating enough income not them not working hard enough.
		And considering healthcare costs will be cheaper in general this isnt
		tough to handle. So my answer is no. You dont let them die. Healthcare
		is a right of all people. End of story. You are a US citizen you get
		care. period

			You upset Progressive your confusion is noted. Healthcare is not a
			right and you can't prove that it is.

				What more fundamental job does a government have than making sure
				it's people are alive and well? The fuck do we have a military for if
				we're just gonna let people die from preventable causes at home?
				Though I'm glad your honest about your position. You are pro-letting
				people die. You are pro-preventable death. Congrats you're a
				reprehensible piece of shit.

	Nope you are wrong the failure of Obamacare is tied right to Barack
	Obama and the Democrats that still support the failure that it is.

		It got passed. Unlike the republicans bill. Not to mention most of
		its provisions have an over 60% favorability. The only part of
		obamacare that is universally hated is the individual mandate to buy
		private insurance. More people have health insurance than before
		obamacare and insurance companies are required to pay out 80% of every
		premium dollar as opposed to 60-70% before obamacare. Explain how
		exactly obamacare is a failure.

			Obamacare is an absolute failure and if you payed attention you would
			see that it is. Tell me how many Obamacare exchanges have failed !
			[Posted by outlaw60 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

				Because the private insurance companies back out of it. That's their
				fault not obamacares fault though I have no fucking clue why they
				would even allow them to back out of it. Obamacare isn't some grand
				solution to healthcare. But it's a fact that premiums were set to rise
				no matter what. Even if obamacare wasn't passed your premiums STILL go
				up. And obamacare actually made it so they went up less than if
				nothing was passed.

	Do you really need a shining example of government run healthcare ?
	Take a look at the VA and then i want you to tell me how well
	government runs healthcare. Government knows nothing about healthcare
	their not in the business of knowing how to run businesses. Leave it
	up to Progressives like yourself and you want government to run
	everything. That is called Socialism !
	[Posted by outlaw60 at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

		Oh you mean the horrendously understaffed and overwhelmed VA?
		interesting you bring that up. Because when Bernie was head of the VA
		he recognized how understaffed it was and proposed a bill to build
		more clinics and hire more doctors to meet the demand. The republicans
		voted against it. Its funny how republicans bitch about failures when
		they actively work against making it better. The government cant run
		healthcare? Tell that to France who is #1 in the world in terms of
		healthcare costs and outcomes with a single payer system. Tell that to
		the UK who is higher ranked than us. Tell that to canada who is higher
		ranked than us. Single payer systems crush private insurance on every
		measurable metric. I dont want the government making my video games. I
		dont want the government baking my wedding cakes. I dont want the
		government manufacturing my cars. There are tons of things, in fact,
		the vast majority of things should not be under government control.
		However there are some select industries which just function more
		cheaply and efficiently under public control than private control. For
		instance road construction and maintenance. Do i wanna pay a toll to a
		private company every 5 miles i drive? No. Its better to pay that in
		taxes and let the state maintiain the roads. Same with healthcare. I
		do not want a for-profit middle man in my healthcare system getting
		rich off of human suffering and denying people care. I do not want a
		middle man who just jacks up prices artificially and only pays out 80%
		of every dollar i give them to my care and pockets the rest. Fuck
		that. Thats idiotic. Thats a shitty system. Healthcare works better in
		a not for profit model. It is socialism. And? Republicans act like all
		they have to say is the word socialism and they win the argument. No
		you havent made an argument. You havent demonstrated why socialism is
		problematic. And when you press them on this they always say the same
		shit. Socialism = communism oooh scarry ooga booga the big bad
		government is gonna put is all in FEMA camps soon. its just bullshit
		slippery slope arguments about spooky words. Theres no evidence to
		trace socializing medicine to a communist uprising. Hence canada, uk,
		sweden, norway, france. Ect. But republicans will always bring up
		venezuela. Did any of us reference venezuela? No. Do any of us
		advocate for any policies in venezuela? No. We tell you specifically
		THESE are the countries we want to model our healthcare after. That
		does not mean that we love every single country that identifies as
		socialist.

			The VA was run under the Obama Regime for 8 years so tell me all
			about the great things the Obama Regime did for the VA. Now that is
			government run healthcare so tell all about the great things Obama did
			for the VA !

				Obama isn't in charge of legislating the budget you idiot. There's
				not much he could do aside from supporting legislation in congress.
				You know the legislation I just told you about that would have FIXED
				the VA but the republicans blocked it. Why did republicans block a
				bill that would fix the va?

That can mean only one thing - It is taking its last breaths. It will
soon die out on itself. Though they won't outright say it, their
justification would be along the lines of "to err is human".

The ACA was never intended to work. It was meant to drive insurance
companies out of the market. Which is happening now. Then the plan was
to have Congress step in and save us all with "single payer". The plan
went South when the Democrats lost first the House, then the Senate,
then the presidency. No one left to push the final vote to single
payer. Republicans now have to restore years of damage and create
something that will actually work.

When Anthem quits, consumers in parts of Colorado, Kentucky, Missouri
and Ohio would be at risk of having no Obamacare insurers for next
year, according to an analysis from Axios, a news website. Humana's
exit, similarly, will leave parts of Tennessee with no ACA insurance
options, though state officials have said they're working to attract
other insurers. The impulsion of Obamacare is there for all to see !

Well then this Republican controlled Washington needs to get their
replacement plan finished and approved, don't they?
[Posted by Grenache at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	No they really don't just let the failure of Obamacare take place and
	it will. Not Republicans problem to save the Democrats on their
	failure of Obamacare.

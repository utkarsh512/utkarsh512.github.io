	It’s true. Red America is countryfolk, and countryfolk don’t live
	near other country folk. It takes close contact to spread the virus,
	and country folk ain’t got that. So what are you saying Con? Evolution
	works?

	It is a fascinating article. Thanks for sharing. I agree with excon
	that the location of the survey population is very important to give
	it context.

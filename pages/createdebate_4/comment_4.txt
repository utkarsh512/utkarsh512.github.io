All people already born have the right to live unless they choose not
to. I have the right to live whether I am disabled or not. Are you
people awake yet? Fascists like this are among us.

Its generally wrong in a moral sense. It is highly disrespectful. I
see his point as well though. Technology can save us from that though.
Or at least I hope.

	If you can see his point, remove yourself from my list. I support
	DEMOCRATIC eugenics that prevents conception, not destroys a life
	already in existence.

		I don't favor his side I just know it well because history shows it
		often. I am on your side here. I posted that in all of my arguments
		that I don't agree with his opinion. I just stated and elaborated what
		he tried to say in a nicer way so it won't offend and since its a
		debate I had to make it sound like an argument. I fully support you
		here.

		What is democratic eugenics? I know at least that a person persuaded
		of his genetic inferiority would never go trough an irreversible
		procedure, because it would seems pointless to him. It's hardly a
		democratic thing for 51% of people to see themselves as superior and
		permanently hinder the minorities unable to make children.

I want you dead because you don't worship Satan and instead worship
his enemy.

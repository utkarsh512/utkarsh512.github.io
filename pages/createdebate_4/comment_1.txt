OAC Calls for Democrat To Drop Out Because She Disagrees with Him on
an Issue Hello bront: Let me remind you that politics isn't beanbag..
Yes. She made DEMANDS.. What BLOWS my mind, however, is that you
support a fuck who not only makes DEMANDS, but do so in the most
VILEST way imaginable.. excon

		DUMMY might you have clue as to where that money comes from ??????
		Money is a social construct, it comes from the state's imagination.

				The federal reserve conjures money out of thin air. It isn't even
				backed by anything and even if it was, what does one resource like
				gold have to do with every other resource? The fact that you are
				worried about how much of an abstract concept something will cost
				rather than real resources proves that you (and most of society) are
				the ones who are insane.

						You have an abstract concept of something you know nothing about
						??????? Indeed, money isn't real but resources ARE. Capitalism makes
						it so that things cannot get done, regardless of whether we have the
						resources, if we can't "afford" it. Capitalism makes it so that things
						that SHOULDN'T be done because we DON'T have the resources do get
						done, because using those resources is profitable.

										It is a social construct, society believes in money so we assign
										value to wealth but if no one on earth believed currency had value
										then it wouldn't make a difference how much of it you supposedly have.
										Sure, paper and coin are real but value is subjective and their status
										as money is socially constructed.

												Money matters when you live in a society such as this, don't get me
												wrong. Just because I know money is a social construct doesn't mean I
												refuse to use it or obtain it.

														What part of this do you not comprehend? A) Money is a social
														construct B) Capitalism leads to the misuse of resource because
														society prioritizes a social construct over physical resources and
														their logical use. C) You need money to function in a capitalist
														society because society revolves around the social construct of money
														and your access to resources depends on it.

					What !!!!!!!!!!!!! Leftist in NYC need fuel oil ???????????? Say it
					ain't so !!!!!! LMMFAO !!!! Air pollution is one of the most
					significant environmental threats facing New York City, contributing
					to approximately 6 percent of deaths in the city each year. Fine
					particulate matter (PM 2.5) in New York City-one of the primary
					pollutants tracked by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
					(EPA)-causes more than 3,000 deaths, 2,000 hospital admissions for
					lung and heart conditions, and approximately 6,000 emergency
					department visits for asthma in children and adults annually. Just 1
					percent of all buildings in the city produce 86 percent of the total
					soot pollution from buildings-more than all the cars and trucks in New
					York City combined. They do this by burning the dirtiest grades of
					heating fuel available, known as residual oil, or #6 and #4 heating
					oil. https://www1.nyc.gov/html/gbee/html/ codes/heating.shtml Meth
					Head are you to believe that the Leftist Global Chaos crowd does not
					need fossil fuel for heat ????????????

Not much choice of columns here, Bront. Just one question â€¦ is the
First Amendment ONLY for conservatives?? Or can anyone participate?
Trump thinks they should ALL drop out and leave the authoritarianism
to HIM! (She disagrees with THAT, also ;-)! Women can be SO
disagreeable, but, they have RIGHTS, whether cons like it or not! At
least until you totalitarians take over! :-(

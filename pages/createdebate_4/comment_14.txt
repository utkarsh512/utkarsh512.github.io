I think Christie will be the nominee. I think he has a lot of the
same qualities that Romney has that got him the nomination.

	I know it sounds bad, and in some ways it is, but I legitimately
	would be afraid of someone that obese being president due to the
	number of possible health complications that could occur. Not only
	that but, visually, I think his image would not be a net positive for
	America considering we are already viewed as one of the most obese
	nations in the world (thanks Mexico for taking the crown). Not saying
	I think his weight should be anyone's business in his private life,
	but I think when it comes to Presidential politics these things need
	to be considered.

		He isn't obese, he just hasn't grown into his body yet. It is a well
		known fact that he just has big bones. He is not overweight, he is
		undertall. He is not fat, he is festively plump. He is not fat, he
		just has different life choices.

		His weight will probably be a factor, but we have had heavy
		presidents in the past. He can play off that fact and make it
		inconsequential (maybe). I can't predict who would be selected by
		Republicans, and since it seems unreasonable for Christie to be the
		nominee, I think that makes him more likely. I never thought they
		would pick a Mormon, and now we are faced with the idea that they
		would never pick a fat guy. Who knows.

		We have had many unhealthy presidents in the past. Ronald Reagan was
		74(?) for his second term. He was suspected of having dementia or
		Alzheimer's. Reagan would have been more likely to drop dead than
		Christie (probably). Image-wise, we could also claim that an old crone
		like Hilary would not present the right image as the POTUS.

			I definitely agree regarding Reagan, and would add JFK to that as
			well. As for Hillary, I disagree. The image of an old woman is not
			inherently negative the way a very obese man is.

				The ratio of obese male to old female leaders in the US would
				indicate otherwise. This is a simplification, but still works.

		There's absolutely nothing bad or wrong about what you're saying. If
		he cannot be trusted to look after his own health he cannot look after
		a whole nation. It also shows laziness and reflects badly on him as a
		person.

He is smart, tough, and seems honest, and stands by his convictions,
but allows room for change if so convinced. which is a very good
quality in prospective president.

That fat bastard will not win. Not because he is fat, but because he
is a bastard.
[Posted by flewk at 2015-07-01T19:31:48+00:00 - Side: No Way!]

I don't think so. People like Paul and Rubio probably have a better
chance.

Since in truth the party leaders pick the nominee, it is unlikely
that Christie will be chosen because he is not a conservative and he
scares independents as to aggressive in his approach to politics. The
party will choose the one most likely to win in the general election,
and that ain't Christie.

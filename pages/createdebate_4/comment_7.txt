I don't hate the President, but this is my body, I have the right to
have healthcare. If it were not for state healthcare, I would not be
alive. Don't I have rights?

I believe everybody should have equal access to healthcare. It
shouldn't come down to being rich or having a good insurance policy.
At the very least there should be a public system to ensure everybody
can get medical help. The American insurance system is draconian, as
Michael Moore illustrated in 2007 when he released Sicko. Obama tried
to do something about it; Republicans cried bloody murder for eight
years then undid everything Obama did in eight hours.

	I agree. I have aways believed in healthcare rights. It's so strange
	that a lot of prolifers demand the mother give her body as healthcare
	for her baby, but don't care about people like me, who would die
	without state healthcare. I know we had our differences, but we have
	some things in common.

		something about how Republicans are pro-life... Until you hit 18.

			I remember that. I agree with a lot of His political standes, and
			might add that a Christian like me, can listen to an atheist like him.
			It is too bad that he is not here to make us think anymore.

				believe Carlin was a comedic genius. Unfortunately, he was right at
				the end of his life before I was ever exposed to his stuff. People
				talk about Bill Hicks a lot as a comedy legend (which he is, I'm not
				disagreeing), but for me Carlin was the all-time master. He had that
				rare talented combination of being able to say outrageous stuff, while
				simultaneously making it seem like the most natural, obvious thing in
				the world. A very astute and witty guy.

Comments:

I oppose political parties in general at a conceptual level, as in my
opinion they encourage groupthink and a focus on certain issues at the
expense of others. I don't believe politicians or citizens should be
classified by political parties, so much as specific issues, and those
limited to what the candidate will actually be able to take direct
action on should they be elected to the position in question. I
admittedly do not have a perfectly thought out replacement program,
but I feel that a citizen's right to vote should be the right to make
an informed vote, and "I call myself a Democrat so I'll vote for the
Democrat" does not an informed vote make, in my opinion.

	I oppose political parties too but I am closest to a Libertarian.

	Damn it, could you let me type my own argument for once?
	[Posted by DrawFour at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

Republican.
[Posted by ProLogos at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

None of the above. Nah i probably align best with the Green Party .

	Can you tell me about the Green Party? I don't know much about it.

		The green party is a political party that believes in helping the
		environment. A green party senator/ congressman, would make laws that
		concern stopping tree killing, etc. It basically means, if their
		legislation passes, then the government changes to fit solutions to
		environmental issues.

			Oh, rock on. It is good that they help the environment. .

	I always said, if I ever vote, that's the one I'd go for. I remember
	back in high school we did mock votes, and the school ballots only
	listed the big two parties, they listed "other" and the had an empty
	slot for your own nomination that was not on the list. Well this was
	high school so me a large group of my friends voted 'cookie' but I was
	seriously considering the green party, since I support more of their
	views than any part in particular.

		I know. It freaking sucks how i cant find a party that aligns
		completely with myself. Like i absolutely hate the conservative
		socials views but then again im not for a large federal government nor
		is that what the founders intended through the constitution, and i
		align with most of the liberal social views but i dont like their
		favor of big government. And any party that isnt republican or
		democrat has almost no chance of winning.

None really.... but the libertarian party will get my vote over the
other lame ass choices.
[Posted by Hellno at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	I agree. I am an independent but I support the Libertarian Party
	above all the others. :)
	[Posted by SitaraMusica at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

Neither. I do not need some political machine to do my thinking for
me. I can think for myself.
[Posted by Rotbart at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	I do not need a party either, but the Libertarian Party is the
	closest to to my beliefs.
	[Posted by SitaraMusica at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

		I used to be a Republican, then I became a Libertarian. I would have
		stayed a libertarian if the party platform were focused solely on the
		freedom of individual citizens. Unfortunately, it is more focused on
		the liberty of corporate non-human entities, and deregulating markets
		(something history has repeatedly shown to not work well for most
		people) which can and do harm the liberties of the individual.
		Corporations are political machines in their own rights. So, to me, it
		doesn't make sense to limit the power of the government in the name of
		freedom, and then NOT limit the power of corporate entities because
		both can be a threat to the freedom of individuals; more often than
		not it is corporations that usurp liberty. I would argue that the
		seediest parts of our political system stem from how much power
		corporations and corporate lobbyists have over our elected officials:
		that is corruption. You cannot fix that by burning it down. You have
		to empower the citizens, and you cannot empower citizens when
		corporations become the new feudal lords.

			I would rather be a Libertarian though because they respect human
			rights better than any other party.
			[Posted by SitaraMusica at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

				I might eventually change to libertarian party because they do
				support the most individual rights... The thing about that is that it
				might be our future. I see opposing sides to that separate debate
				already. Some say that a new party could never take power. Others say
				that libertarianism might be our future. One side of hypothetical
				debate: http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/ 2014/02/20/ the-end-of-

					It is awesome that you are open minded. I respect that about you.

				They support human rights unless you're a worker and you want to
				unionize. When was the last time Libertarians supported unions or
				higher wages, or workers benefits? They don't. They support the
				corporations "liberty" to pay as little as they want and frame workers
				rights and benefits as a "choice." Really, it is leftist parties that
				support human rights. Libertarians just support the liberty of the
				wealthy. Leftists tend to have a much better track record with civil
				rights, civil liberties, and human rights. Libertarians, on the other
				hand (looking back to when they were called Classical Liberals),
				brought us things like the 18 hour work day, racism, the six day work
				week, child labor, environmental disasters, and the "liberty" of
				corporations to hire armed thugs to beat or kill anyone who spoke out
				in their own interest. Sitara, please do not think I think this about
				you specifically. I just used to be a Libertarian, and I am trying to
				show you what caused me to leave it. It isn't a movement for people
				like us or the working people of the US, but it is sold to us in a
				very convincing way.

					Libertarians support all human rights and oppose all tyranny.
					[Posted by SitaraMusica at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

						If that were true, then how come we do not see more Democrats (the
						party with the best human rights/civl rights record of the two),
						losing people to the Libertarians? We only see Republicans becoming
						Libertarians. Why do we not see more Unions supporting the Libertarian
						party (versus vile billionaire robber barons like the Kochs)? Why do
						we not see hardcore lefties that are against any violence supporting
						libertarians? It's because human rights are not at the forefront of
						libertarianism, "liberty" is; Social Darwinism is. In order to believe
						that libertarianism works, you have to believe that the cream always
						rises to the top, and that the people at the top are better than
						everyone else. If the Libertarian Party were actually concerned with
						supporting rights, they wouldn't be aimed at deregulating that which
						was put in place to support rights. They would be supportive of
						existing rules. I know the allure of libertarianism, as it is sold to
						us, is very alluring. I fell for it myself. I am telling you though:
						libertarianism is classical liberalism re-packaged, and we know what
						that looks like in practice, and it isn't good for us. You don't have
						to believe me. I don't care. I am just confronting you with the facts
						about the end state of libertarian policies. It is the mid-late 19th
						century. If you want to repeat a mistake in history, go ahead and be a
						libertarian, but if that movement gets what it wants, after you're
						done celebrating, and then you chained to a piece of factory equipment
						for 18 hours a day, six days a week, denied a right to unionize, and
						given only one bathroom break all day, remember I warned you about
						that. Libertarians are anti-union, anti-regulation, anti-worker
						protection rights, anti-social safety net, pro-employer (based on
						social darwinist thinking, which makes it okay because the stronger
						party deserves to do it, and it's 'wrong to inhibit the successful').
						Everything the libertarians want, has been tried before, and it was a
						horrible time to be a non-millionaire. If you were rich, it was a good
						time, but for 99.5% of Americans, it was functionally feudalism.

							You are wrong. The Libertarian Party is minarchist in nature, not
							anarchist. Anarchists do not believe in taxes, but Libertarians do,
							therefore they are minarchist in nature.
							[Posted by SitaraMusica at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

								I understand the difference between Classical Liberalism and anarchy.
								Minarchism does not protect anyone from the stronger party. Minarchism
								means that there is enough government to ensure that commerce can
								continue, but not enough to protect workers from their employers, or
								to protect the poor from the rich. Minarchism is "MINIMAL" government;
								that benefits those who are already at the top because then they have
								less government hindering their pursuit of endless wealth at the
								expense of everyone else. Minarchism does not benefit you and I, it
								just benefits the Kochs, and the corporations that dodge taxes. Please
								stop telling me that I am "confused" between minarchism and anarchism.
								I have a degree in history and political science. I have formal
								training in knowing the difference. If you want to know what
								minarchism looks like, look at the 19th Century in the US, and tell me
								how great that was. It was not anarchistic, it was minarchist. We had
								a government, just a very small one with low taxes on the rich, and
								very little regulation (if any). 19th Century America is a
								libertarian's paradise. It was libertarianism in action; that is
								because the Classical Liberal ideals that make up libertarianism were
								the prevailing political/economic theories of the day. In the 19th
								Century, there was just enough government to protect property (and
								most people did not own property, so it protected rich people's
								property, and businesses), and just enough government to ensure
								commerce runs smoothly; there was not enough government for
								unemployment, social security, enforce worker's protection laws,
								enforce environmental laws, or minimum wage.

									Appeal to authority fallacy. Having a degree does not make you right,
									logic does. If you are aware of the difference between minarchism and
									anarchism, you need to admit to being wrong. As a minarchist, I know
									what minarchism truely is.
									[Posted by SitaraMusica at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

										You just appealed to authority by saying you have it simply because
										you're a libertarian (I used to be one too). I am not wrong, because I
										never implied that libertarians are anarchists. You said I said that,
										and I did not. Also, having a degree means I have a higher level of
										knowledge and expertise, so I should be listened to. So far, I've
										spend four years studying history and political science, devoting all
										my time to it. Before that, I studied them on my own for about 15
										years. So, all together, I've got about 19 years studying history and
										political science. It has been my passion since I was very young
										(about 8-9 years old). People do not devote 19 years of their time
										learning about something to make up things and mislead people. Also,
										if you'd noticed, my argument was LOGIC-BASED using historical
										evidence of why classical liberalism (NOT anarchy), doesn't work very
										well, and you haven't confronted that.

											I did not appeal to authority at all because I am not asserting
											myself as an authority about anything but my own beliefs. You have
											failed to prove that , minarchism and anarchism are the same thing
											because they are not. Minarchism supports minimal government.
											Anarchism supports no government. The Libertarian Party is minarchist
											in nature. Political parties are against everything that I used to
											believe as an anarchist.

												did not appeal to authority at all because I am not asserting myself
												as an authority about anything but my own beliefs. When you say, "I am
												a communist, so I know what communism is," it's an appeal to
												authority. Truthfully, I would believe what a communist says about the
												communist party than what a Republican says about it. So, it IS an
												appeal to your authority as a libertarian. It doesn't matter though.
												In that regard, I equal that level of authority because I used to be
												one myself, and I know exactly what I believed. You have failed to
												prove that , minarchism and anarchism are the same thing because they
												are not. That is because I NEVER MADE THAT CLAIM!! Please address the
												points I raised. I feel like you're strawmanning me now. My claim is
												that minarchism, or libertarianism, or classical liberalism, which are
												all the same thing essentially, have been tried before, and they did
												not work. You've ignored that, and went on to straw man me for a claim
												I did not make. I think in every single rebuttal I've made, I've
												pointed out to you that I know what anarchism is and I know what
												minarchism is, and I even spelled-out to you what they were so that
												you knew I understood the difference, then I brought up my degree to
												show that I have at least a basic understanding of political science
												and history so that you could be assured that I knew the difference on
												a fundamental level. It was not meant to establish authority, it was
												meant to assure you that you did not need to keep bringing up
												something that had nothing to do with my argument. In short, I said,
												"in history that has never worked," and you said, "minarchism is
												minimal government and anarchism is not the same." I KNOW THAT, and it
												had nothing at all to do with my argument. My argument is that when
												tried, minarchism does not work well for anyone except those who are
												already in charge, and I proved it with the social, rigid class
												structure, poor distribution of wealth, lack of social safety nets,
												inability of private charity to solve problems, lack of workers
												protections, lack of minimum wage, and lack of regulation of the 19th
												century. It is on you to debunk that by finding some way to prove to
												me that things would not be the same if we tried something again that
												failed before. This is why I have said, "libertarians have to forget
												history to believe what they believe." Again, I have NEVER claimed
												that Libertarianism is anarchism. I know the difference. I haven't
												spent years in college studying political science, having been a
												libertarian myself, to not know a fundamental basic difference like
												that. So, anyway, back to what my actual claim was: we know classical
												liberal policies (that is libertarian policies) do not work because in
												history, they have never worked for anyone except robber barons and
												very, very wealthy people. I hear people say, "communism has never
												worked when tried," and that is a case for not trying it again. So,
												since Libertarianism has never worked when tried, why should we try it
												again?

													I stated that the Libertarian Party was minarchist, and you disputed
													me.
													[Posted by SitaraMusica at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

														No I didn't. To say that it is not minarchist is absurd. That is
														EXACTLY what the Libertarian party is. I have no idea how you came to
														think I said it was not minarchist. So, back to my original argument:
														19th Century America is libertarianism/minarchism/Classical Liberalism
														in action. It was a horrible place to not be rich. Cities were filthy
														cesspools of crime and disease. We saw the worst wealth distribution
														this nation has ever seen. We saw the rise of monopolies and robber
														barons. We saw environmental disasters caused by businesses who were
														unregulated. We saw child labor. We saw women being paid HALF of what
														a man was paid (children paid 1/4 of what a man was paid, typically
														for doing much more dangerous work). We saw slavery. We saw social
														darwinism as the myth to maintain social stability. We saw an
														extremely poor working class. We saw ZERO workers protections. We saw
														states, like California, literally run by big business overtly. We saw
														businesses forcing people to vote for certain candidates. We saw Jim
														Crow south. We saw legal hunting of Native Americans. We saw states
														try to destroy the US because they didn't want to have to listen to
														the Federal government tell their business owners you could not own
														other human beings. We saw agribusiness big whigs denying farm workers
														water. We saw people working for literally no money, and had no choice
														in the matter (they were paid in company scrip, and forced to live in
														a town owned by the company). ALL of these things were made possible
														by minarchism and classical liberalism (which, are now both called
														"Libertarianism") We know that minarchism does not benefit you and I.
														We know it has never worked before for people like us (I'm assuming
														you work for a living and are not a billionaire). So, why should we
														ignore the lessons of history in order to try that system again? It's
														not new. It's been tried, and it was an utter failure for most people.
														Why should we do that again? This does not make me a socialist or what
														you would probably call a "statist." It makes me responsible with my
														vote. It makes me choose the less reactionary route for a more tried-
														and-true route. It makes me a pragmatist. I only care about what has
														worked in the past, or what could work if we try it. Politicians never
														try things that might work. They only keep trying things that have
														never worked before (for the most part); that is why I do not belong
														to a political party. Do you have a compelling reason that I should
														consider disregarding the lessons of history? That is my argument. I
														already knew what the Libertarian Party stood for because I used to be
														one, and I have a degree in political science which means I can at
														least identify a political ideology correctly (it's actually more than
														that, but for the purpose of this, I'll leave it there). Why should we
														try what has already been tried and proven to not work?

Green Party and Democrat. I support the environment, but I believe in
a lot of the things democrats say about relevant changes in today's
world. I believe more immigrants should be allowed, GMOs should be
labeled, abortion should be allowed, and that the dumbest assumption
of the 90s and early 2000s was that global warming was wrong. I don't
let a party do my thinking for me. I simply informed myself on the
issues and decided what I agree with. It's sad that the 28th amendment
is a hoax, because I was looking forward to that...

Green. In the UK, the greens have pretty much claimed the left and
are not just focused on environmental issues. They're looking at drug
legalisation, renationalisation, and raising the minimum wage too.

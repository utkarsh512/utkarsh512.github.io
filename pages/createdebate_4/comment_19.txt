Yes. The idea of affirmative action is itself racist ans sexist and
some of the other -ists. If you get hired because your black or you
are woman it is wrong. You should not except the job.

	Do you have any idea what Affirmative Action was predicated on? You
	should read about it because unfortunately, you don't! "If you get
	hired because your black or you are woman it is wrong. You should not
	except the job." And why shouldn't they if they are qualified to do
	that job? You're spelling is also atrocious. Your = You're, woman = a
	woman, except = accept. My God, hit the darned button and get some
	education!

		I'm going to have to disagree with you here. Except for Tugman's
		spelling and grammar being... pitiful. "If you get hired because your
		black or you are woman it is wrong. You should not except the job."
		And why shouldn't they if they are qualified to do that job? You're
		arguing both sides of the fight, it seems. Are you saying it's OK for
		an employer to need to hire someone because they are a gender or skin
		color ? If you are, I can't understand why someone would think that.
		That is absolutely not OK. But, if you're saying someone should only
		be hired if they are the best one for the job , no matter what color,
		sex, or anything they are! Each person should be judged depending on
		what they know and what they do. Not what happened to their ancestors,
		what their ancestors did, or what color they are. That is just not
		right.

				That was uncalled for and a direct hit on yourself. You really
				shouldn't make yourself appear that ignorant.

					Frenchieak has been my friend for many years and I meant it as a
					joke. He knows that. He thought the plural for sheep was shoop.

			Oh Frenchie...I wish you were around then, I really do. My sentiments
			have always been that the person best suited for the job should get
			that job...period, end of statement. But in the beginning, it didn't
			happen that way. Blacks and women were still not being hired until
			they were forced to be hired by the quota system. A terrible way to go
			but necessary to get them into the work force. Then a more terrible
			thing happened. The quota system backfired and employers found
			themselves being sued left and right for NOT hiring a black or a
			woman! It was awful. In today's world it has changed, a lot, and I say
			thank God for it. Even before the quota system hit the ranks, kids
			still couldn't get into their school of choice even though they had
			the grades to get in! We actually had to force them to let them go to
			school if they were qualified! Disgusting. I didn't say If you get
			hired because you're a black or a woman it is wrong...Tugman did. I
			asked him if these people were qualified to do that job why shouldn't
			they be hired? They should be and we must still take care that these
			things do not happen again...because they can. But as I say, it is
			quite different today in many, many places.

				What about the white people that do not the job? It is making it fair
				for one person while making it unfair for another. The President of
				the United States of America is black. Is Affirmative action really
				necessary?
				[Posted by Tugman at 2009-04-01T20:54:21+00:00 - Side: Yes.]

					I don't understand your question Tugman! "What about the white people
					that do not the job?" Do not WHAT the job? Affirmative action doesn't
					make it fair for one and not for the other. It levels the playing
					field so the job or market is open to all. Just because President
					Obama is half black does not mean we have succeeded fully, yet! It's
					not going to all go away simply because he is half black and half
					white! You forget about the terrible racism that still exists in some
					parts of our country.

						I forgot to put in get. Racism is never going to go away and the best
						thing to do is to ignore it because no one is inferior to others just
						because their skin is a different pigmentation.

							Ok...What about the white man who didn't get the job? Was he more
							qualified than the black man or the woman who applied? How would you
							know who was more qualified? By what you just said it would seem that
							the white man should have gotten the job! As long as people think that
							way, if indeed you did, there will be a need for Affirmative Action.
							We must not ignore it and we dare not ignore it until the problem is
							solved and forever done away with. You're right, no one is inferior by
							virtue of their skin color nor are they inferior because they happen
							to be a woman.

		I am sorry you cannot stand mistakes. Can you please enlighten me on
		what Affirmative Action is predicated on. About the education button,
		it is only for spelling not grammar.

			It's not that I can't stand mistakes Tug...it's that they are, for
			the most part, easily correctable here. Why not use the spell checker
			to your advantage? I know it doesn't handle grammar but I guess we
			cannot have everything. Here's your site if you wish to inform
			yourself about Affirmative Action. There are many more. If you need
			more than this simply type Affirmative Action in a search box.

The purpose of the civil rights movement was to give all races and
genders equal rights and opportunities. Not to diversities every
single thing. And certainly not to give the minority more opportunity
than the majority. Let's not forget the significants of the civil
rights movement.
[Posted by JakeJ at 2009-03-31T11:09:36+00:00 - Side: Yes.]

	Which Civil Rights Movement are you talking about? You haven't the
	faintest idea what you're speaking of. The original movement had to do
	with African-Americans receiving the same rights as Whites and NOTHING
	else! What is "diverities" and why don't you learn how to spell
	correctly so you, in some small way, seem to know what you're talking
	about? You meant to say not to diversify every single thing which is
	something it never tried to do to begin with! Who asked for the
	minority to have MORE opportunity than the majority? All men and are
	created equal and look for nothing more but that equality that is
	spoken of but few get! EQUALITY is what it was about! RIGHT...let's
	NOT forget the significants of the Civil Rights movement! The
	significants and the significance of the Civil Rights Movement were
	the Blacks and the way Whites treated them.

		"Which Civil Rights Movement are you talking about?" Which one do you
		think I'm talking about? l: What did I not spell correctly? I do admit
		that I used the wrong word(you knew what I meant), But you where
		wrong. I spelled everything correctly. Anyways, Companies try to hard
		to show diversity. If everyone is created equal why does that have to
		matter? "Who asked for the minority to have MORE opportunity than the
		majority?" Collages who give minorities more of a financial break.
		"All men and are created equal and look for nothing more but that
		equality that is spoken of but few get!" They already have equality.
		Did you mean results ? Because that is on them. Equal results where
		never guarantied. "the significance of the Civil Rights Movement were
		the Blacks and the way Whites treated them." Nope, you are seeing it
		wrong. The importance of the civil rights movement is that Americans
		came together. No good guys and bad guys. We are all good guys. It
		wasn't a movie. Just Americans. There is no black America there is no
		white America there is the United STATES of America. Obama said
		something like that. One of the better things he has said.

			Once again you are dead wrong! And for once I'm not going to waste my
			time explaining things to you. If you cannot, at the very least, be a
			responsible debater and person...the clocks have just timed out. You
			have no desire to read about anything or back yourself up by
			researching. All you can do and all you've ever done is write stuff
			you happen to think. Even when someone disproves what you've written,
			all you can ever do is defend yourself and your errors in content and
			English. Go learn something about this country and when you do, get
			back to me...or not! No you didn't spell everything correctly...one
			isn't even a word! On this one: Where for were, Collages for Colleges,
			guarantied (V) for guaranteed.

I believe that everyone of us should be given equal right for
whatever position as long as we are qualified and highly motivated for
the job. Regardless of our gender and race. I can see no reason why
you can't have the job just because of your skin color. Why, is the
color now affects how you preforms at work and how you think?
[Posted by rafael at 2009-04-01T02:17:53+00:00 - Side: Yes.]

Some may not like it but I don't see any getting out of it.
Affirmative Action is here to stay.
[Posted by PhxDemocrat at 2015-07-17T04:01:58+00:00 - Side: Yes.]

No, I do not. We still require these things, therefore they must
remain in place. Until we can require our legislature to create
fairness for all people in the marketplace, we darned sure need these
programs to create and uphold opportunities for all.
[Posted by Kuklapolitan at 2009-03-31T22:18:38+00:00 - Side: No.]

	As much as I agree that we need to have opportunities for all, I feel
	that affirmative action creates more opportunities for minorities than
	there should be. Nowadays, some colleges factor in race, gender, and
	religion. It's unfair to the majority when a college must meet a quota
	for the number of black students, the male to female ratio, and the
	different numbers needed for each other race or religion. This makes
	it more difficult for the average white male, the majority, simply
	because of his gender and race. This is racism. It may seem more
	acceptable, but it is still racism (and sexism too). I think
	affirmative action is just an undercover way of making up for lost
	time for blacks, women, etc. Since they had no chance whatsoever many
	years ago, they now get a better chance. It's almost as if
	preferential treatment is a way of saying sorry for oppression.

	Oh and by the way, kudos for fighting an uphill battle here. You're
	the only one on your side and if I were in that position I might have
	backed down by now. You're a strong woman. :)

There doesn't seem to be enough preferential treatment for me. I need
more. ;)

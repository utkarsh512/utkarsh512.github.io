How is one type of war "worst" then the other?

	When one type of war is attacking their own people. They don't gain
	land, they just kill citizens of their own land.

		Murder is equally bad no matter who is doing it Quocalimar.

			Obviously murder is bad, but soldier generally get a pass for it
			because they are doing it for their country they are doing it for
			peace. What peace is being made when people kill one another?

				So are you saying Peace=War so how are soldiers fighting equal peace?

					When soldiers fight to battle oppression. Ex. America fighting to
					escape British rule. They were fighting for the right to be their own
					country and in the end they got it, they got freedom.

						Yes I do agree about that but every war should be avoided if it can

A civil war isn't the "worst" kind of war. Other wars can be just as
bad, and worse.

	On principle, the people are doing acts of war, to their own people.

		say there is a war between countries and 1 million people die. And
		there is a civil war with 1000 deaths. Is the civil war worse? Certain
		wars can be much worse.

			I understand what you are saying but you are basing it on differences
			in specifics wars. If the wars are the same, and 1 million people die
			in both of them, in the civil war 1 million people died for nothing,
			as opposed to 1 million people dying in the war between countries
			where hopefully something was gained.

				Notice how you said hopefully something is gained. Maybe civil wars
				are sometimes worth fighting, and wars among countries are sometimes
				pointless. My point is, it is not about the kind of war. Its about the
				reason the war is being fought.

	Exactly 7thDebater War should always be a last resort and not the
	first option.

Nope. To me a civil war is the only type of war in which a country
can be improved in a moral way; people fighitng for liberty or
whatever. In international war you are either fighting to defend
yourself e.g maintain the status quo or you're destroying someone
elses country for your own gain.

The war against ones own self is the worst type of war.
[Posted by Akulakhan at 2013-05-12T19:04:59+00:00 - Side: No it's not]

War should only happen if life or civil liberties are at stake. .

I think history is important in order to forge a path for the future.
The only way to improve ourselves in the future we need to know of our
past mistakes and succeses .

	i agree that history does have value outside of academics because we
	should know past mistakes to ensure that we don't repeat them. if we
	look to the future without knowing of the mistakes in the past, we
	will just mess up again over and over in the same way that our
	ancestors have. we will never progress forward and we will all be
	doomed!

	True. I completely agree with what you say, but as I said in my
	earlier post, "History is bound to repeat itself because we pay such
	little attention to it the first time." and that goes for everyone.
	Some people more than once, but that is just the fact of the matter.
	History is important outside of academics, yes, but has no value to
	the common person.

History has value outside of academics. It has value on the
battlefield. We won't make the same mistakes we made in World War 1
because we learned from it. Military history helps a lot on the
battlefield not just in academics
[Posted by RomanN at 2008-05-29T08:02:41+00:00 - Side: Yes]

	I agree with this statement because we can learn from mistakes made
	in the past and not make that same mistake again.

	Really? I think war is one of those things the world absolutely
	learns nothing from. I mean, we're still fighting, so what exactly are
	we learning? To use a better and bigger gun? To make more disguisable
	spy planes? To train the military men more efficiently? Wow. But in
	the end, does it all ever really solve anything? Not in my opinion.

Knowing the names, dates, and places of past events is utterly
useless, unless you really enjoy playing Trivial Pursuit and annoying
people at parties. But deep study of history -- retracing, recreating
situations and events in your imagination, reconsidering decisions
that were made, and how the flow of events may have been influenced as
a result -- adds depth, color, and meaning to current events, and can
help you better weigh the consequences of decision you make throughout
your life. That said, the question of whether history is necessary is
very different from whether it has any value outside of academics. The
study of history is not for everyone. Just as rigorous daily fitness
training is only necessary for professional athletes, not everyone
needs to be able to spot patterns, understand how events are related,
and be able to apply that to decisions under consideration. But
everyone can benefit from a little exercise now and then.

Yes, because we can learn from mistakes made in the past and not make
that same mistake again.
[Posted by Jonathan at 2008-05-29T08:35:06+00:00 - Side: Yes]

	Expanding on your argument here. Well, in history, we learn how
	people make mistakes. For example, how Hitler played on the feelings
	of the German public to bring himself into power and bring about the
	monstrosity that was the German War Machine. We also learn of how
	childish politics like the Cold War are for naught. When we look at
	these mistakes and see a similar situation happening/brewing, we would
	know what has happened, is happening, and what will happen. If
	everyone took a deeper insight into history, or at least the more
	significant bits, everyone would be more enlightened and would know
	when a tyrant is about to take power and can unite to take him down.
	It also serves as a great source of jokes and for conversation topics.

Yes because if you trying to make a game about World War One and you
just make it people that play it will not get it. So if you want to be
a game programmer like me you need to your history be for you start. _

History DOES have value because our children will need to learn what
our forefathers did in the past, How they fought, why, and when.
History is also valuable because we need to learn from their mistakes
and never cause another war.

	Hitler knew well the history of Germany; that was the cause of WWII.

History definitely has value outside of academics. It's been said
that "those that cannot remember the past are destined to repeat it" .
It is crucial for us to learn from past mistakes and successes so we
can build on those learnings to help us make better decisions.
[Posted by borme at 2008-05-29T09:16:11+00:00 - Side: Yes]

I do believe that history have a value outside of academics, because
I believe that if someone doesn't know their past they don't know they
future. I believe its really necessary to know history, because you
wouldn't be able to decide or have option since you wouldn't know what
happen in the past with similar things.
[Posted by abrahamponce at 2008-05-29T11:56:53+00:00 - Side: Yes]

We learn from our past, and the past is history, so we need history.
Take engineering for example, Engineers want to build a building but
they want to try something they think is new. If we didn't have
history to show that some things didn't work in the past we would be
making the same mistakes over, and over, and over again. So in order
to move on with life we have history to show are mistakes so we can
improve them, and make the world go round.
[Posted by Danielle at 2008-05-30T10:26:12+00:00 - Side: Yes]

History is important because you can compare it to situations of
today and have more insight into what is going on. But I do agree with
the notion that not a lot of people do study history. Just look at why
the revolution happened. They were revolting against a big government
with a Central Bank that inflated the money pool while controlling
it's political pawns and taxing the colonists senselessly for no
adequate reason. And yet we have a central bank today (Federal
Reserve) which is a private company that can create money out of thin
air. And we have an IRS that collects a tax on income to pay for
inflated government spending. Both of which are against the
constitution. So Yes, it is important to know history to have a clue
what is going on today; History does repeat itself often and is also
what came before. How can you fully understand today without knowing
how it got that way? However that doesn't mean that people can't get
along without learning history but often it is to their own detriment.
Especially when red flags start to go off that should alert you; such
as preemptive war; torturing; removal of habeas corpus etc.

I can't believe this is even up for debate and that some people are
saying no! If you don't remember what you did yesterday, last week,
last month or last year, how are you ever supposed to improve or get
better at anything? How will you know if you have made this mistake
already? Over time you learn and going forward you apply the lessons
from your history! Imagine if we had no personal history? We'd be
messed up like that guy in Memento! (very good movie by the way -
check it out) Society is no different, if we can't remember electing
some idiot who ruined our economy and got us into a deadly expensive,
totally unnecessary war 8 years ago, we are doomed to reelect someone
similar! As a society we need to know what happened in the past so we
can avoid making similar mistake in the future! Also, there is a
history to every subject: Computer Science, Political Science,
Chemistry, Physics, Literature, Economics, etc. Knowing how we got to
whatever point in our fields helps give us the perspective wee need to
push it forward.

History is not trivia. History is more than just dates and people.
When you learn from your own mistakes, do you think "on March 25th,
2005, at a fast food restaurant in South Dakota, I tried to eat a bean
burrito without a napkin, and it was messy." or do you think, "This
has been tried before, let's not do that again"?
[Posted by repmetnellaf at 2008-06-03T04:58:22+00:00 - Side: Yes]

History outside of academics is, at the very least, a most
interesting subject. It contains the sum of our knowledge at any given
moment in time and a most valuable asset if only for the purpose of
debate!

The way i see it, know history, know self. know self, know who you
want to be and where you want to go.
[Posted by tonicole at 2008-08-01T14:09:46+00:00 - Side: Yes]

I do think that history as a value because you can learn from peoples
mistakes from the past or if not there mistakes there tactics to use
in your life.
[Posted by JoseA at 2008-05-29T08:03:33+00:00 - Side: Yes]

	I agree with you, but are you trying to say about tactics used in war
	or using it to approach with other countries in a peaceful way?
	[Posted by JoseGarcia at 2008-05-29T08:45:13+00:00 - Side: Yes]

		Both ways depending if they can still do it peacefully

Even though history can be fake or maybe been taught wrong, it still
influences people. It influences us because that's is the way people
think how things happen and they learn it generations through
generations,

History is valuable because we can learn what we did in the past and
change the future. For example Martin Luther King Jr make a huge
impact for all races back then during the speech for letting all the
people freedom and equal rights and then now everybody have equal
rights and respect each other race. With out history there would be
any history in life.

Its always good to know about the past. What if your kids ask you to
help them on their homework, or your boss asks you to do a project?
Thats why i think history has a value even if your not in school no
more.
[Posted by valtovar1 at 2008-05-29T08:13:17+00:00 - Side: Yes]

I think yes and so that we don't make the same mistakes over again
like our ancesters like for example we need to know our history like
in world war 1 we now know that we have to make better airplanes not
those other kinds that they had.
[Posted by ECASTRO1992 at 2008-05-29T08:23:04+00:00 - Side: Yes]

	I agree too. Without any knowledge about history we sure going to
	lose at a war.

it means you are always in a Historyc enviroment.

I believe it does, I mean, if it weren't for history in general,
cause and effects of it especially, we wouldn't be who and where we
are today. I know I wouldn't think the same. I appreciate all that has
been done to get us here today. (besides littering, global warming,
etc.) Each landmark makes a difference. So yes, I do believe it does.

Learning history helps us not only because "those who dont know it
are destined to repeat it" but it also helps us develop leadership
skills and military tactic. George Washington studied the roman
empire's history and applied it as a framework for our country, and he
looked to their leaders to learn how to govern the US.

Yes! Firstival, if there's no history, people of your next generation
will forgot the event that had happened in the past. Second, people
thought history is something that happened in the past is not
important cause it already past, but the thats WRONG, it might affect
your future jobs. Sometimes HISTORY REPEATS which means you must know
what happened in the past so you can be prepare. Its good to know an
event war in the past because we don't want to do the same mistake
that had happened before.

Well first of all, i think that history has value. What would life be
without history?? What events would be interesting in?? Like humas we
need to know what had happened in the past so thats why we need to
know about history. Out in the real world is good if you can tell your
family about past events in history for example your childres and
grandchildren. History cannot just be used at school to get a grade
and can be use to have great moments remembering what had happened in
the past.
[Posted by pveronica7 at 2008-05-30T10:22:36+00:00 - Side: Yes]

I think history is important because you can learn from your own
mistakes and learn from what you do. Then why do we have history for?
We have it because its for the past, the present and the future.
History is very important with out history we wouldn't know about our
president we had in the past or the important things from history.
[Posted by DaisyRubio at 2008-05-30T10:41:32+00:00 - Side: Yes]

I think that knowing your history is important because if we don't
learn from our parents' past mistakes then we are doomed to repeat
them.

Yes i believe history has value outside of academics because histrol
not only shows the sucesses we had but many i believe it teaches us
our failures and that we need to learn from it or try something else
and many times we look back in history see what we did wrong and then
we deciede what is right an example is slavery and how if we look in
history we learn that human inslavement is a inhumane thing so we
learn from it and try to prevent slavery in other countries now and
that example why history is important
[Posted by gusmorales at 2008-05-30T13:35:11+00:00 - Side: Yes]

i think history is very important in our lifes, because if we dont
have history how would we know how stuff is done, because everything
that humans have ever created is all HISTORY.

History has a great value outside of academics. We use history in our
everyday routine. History helps us defend ourselves in an argument =].
For example when we fight with our parents and you tell them remember,
Einstein didn't go past 4th grade! so I shouldn't either! ha!

Yes, I do think that history has a value outside of academics. What
we learn in the class is very important but we never think that we are
going to use it in the outside world. You will want to know who the
first president of the United States was and when the Korean or WWI
and II occured. Alot of what we learn in the classroom is something
you will need to know outside of the classroom. That is why we take
history class and learn about the things we learn about. History does
have a value outside of academics.

I've wondered about this topic many times. I learn history, I
remember dates and people. Yet still there's a side of me that wonders
“what will I ever do with this subject?". If you look back on
different events in history, something can help you change your
perspective. I think this is a class that changes your character. When
young African Americans today learn about all the different heroes
that granted their freedom today, they learn to respect. When the
youth today faces conflicts with the older generation they can look
back through history and see when their parents too faced those
conflicts and maybe can learn to compromise. The tragedies that the
past has faced will reflect our future. The things that have already
happened we learn today can change our choices and try to make a
better one that won't result in violence or other bad outcomes.
History indeed should be taken seriously as a core subject. You have
to live in the future, but where would that be if it wasn't for the
past.

we can know and make decisions based on history.

Yes history does have a value out of academics. For example what the
heck are you going to tell your kids. When they need help with there
work. But also it does matter because you do need it outside of school
knowing about the past and know things that will effect the furture
from past things that have happened

Yes history does have a value outside of academics. It doesn't matter
if you don't talk about it even after you get out of school, it's
still important to know about history. If anyone ever asks you a
question, it's good that your able to answer them to help them.

them again.

yes it does...anything you do...anything you learn doesnt have to do
with academics. if i learn and do something it is because I want to
learn it...i dont have much enthusiasim for educational learning for
the purpose of going to college and what-not, but educational learning
for me...i know there are also the cases where you HAVE to learn
something at school to pass the class...but most likely if you dont
want to remember it or you hated learning it, you more then likely
you'll forget it later. history has its own value for itself, history
isnt made for our sake...but because OUR sake...even if we didnt do
anything there would still be history... like the cave men drew on the
walls about what they did...how they hunted they didnt draw it for
themselves, but for future generations like us, we make history
whether we know it or not, i learn history for the value of SELF
value.

doing something stupid.

i think history is very applicable out side of the class room.
learning from the past even the immediate past can give a lot of
insight on many subjects. many goals that have been accomplished
because of the history of a project.

I do think history has a value outside of academics. I think it's
important to know about our past to not do the same mistakes that were
done back then, or maybe to have a guide on how to do certain stuff
that was already done. I think it's cool to learn about History
because somehow or another, they are kind of our ancestors and it's
nice to learn about all the stuff they did, plus you also have the
choice to decide whether the stuff they did had a great impact on our
lives now or not.

History helps us and future generations understand what's happening
today, how todays problems can be solved by looking back and looking
at past succeses, and even learn from past mistakes.
[Posted by sauldiaz at 2008-05-30T08:04:25+00:00 - Side: Yes]

i think we learn the from the past. We tend to be more intelligent to
the decisions we make. Some people have studied history so we wont
repeat the mistakes that we have made in the past...........

Yes, I think that history does have a value outside of academics. I
believe that all people need to know about hisotry and learn why
things are the way they are today, so that can have some understanding
about life through out years. If i saw two people the same and one
knew about history and one didnt I would be able to tell which one had
a understanding of history.

I think that they do have value outside of school because we have
made huge mistakes and they have caused devastation to our country and
if we dont know what happened we can't stop it from happening again,
so that would lead to the world to just crash economically.

I think that we do need history outside academic. We dont want to
make the same mistakes that they did in the past wars. Looking back at
all the history we can learn something and not repeat it.
[Posted by karlagomez at 2008-05-30T08:29:23+00:00 - Side: Yes]

yes, because by the past history you can learn what not to repeat in
the past history and or what to make better in the future by the past
history.

well it kind of those have a value because everything you do it can
make history and then it can be tell in a history class later on when
you did something historical everyone will remenber in and out the
academics

important to learn from our past is like our foundation we need to

there is subverzive history-one writed by the Losers. Which one you

sometimes it hasn't....So on this one I'm going to be a follower which

sometimes use history out of class as in I make sure not to repeat
past mistakes over in the same situations

not only shows the sucesses we had but many i believe it teaches us
our failures and that we need to learn from it or try something else

we deciede what is right an example is slavery and how if we look in
history we learn that human inslavement is a inhumane thing so we
learn from it and try to prevent slavery in other countries now and
that example why history is important outside of academics

past made mistakes and people today should learn from that and try not
to repeat it. It helps us create new paths in today's world by telling
us the failures and successes of the people in the past. History also
tells us about the people that changed the world. For example, Martin
Luther King, he stood up for what he believed in and that helped to
shape the world we live in now. We can learn from this and be inspired

	reflect. Also, learning history allows us to look back and see just
	how far we've come as a society. In all history reminds us of our

you are forced to memorize throughout your life really come in handy.

	You have got to be kidding me. History is essential to the real world
	of business. History is how we evaluate the past and plan for the
	future. What about the historical performance of the New York Stock
	Exchange, doesn't matter? What about the history of fiscal &amp;
	monetary policy? I challenge you to find one credible source of
	information that says that history isn't needed for the real world of
	business.

	And miss out on a rich source of knowledge to start small talk on?
	Dont you business people need some form of small talk to warm up to
	your clients? Its always good to add a personal touch to your approach
	to business. You dont have to STUDY history, just know roughly what
	people are talking about.

I like to disagree, the reason is because not everything in history
is accurate. So when asking about if you need it outside of acedemics
I really dont think so. You are taught something that was thought to
have happen hundreds of years ago. The only place people will need it
other than acedmics is in debates to prove their statement or in
museums. Other than that people just really concentrate on working and
hoping that they can make next months rent.

	how is history not reliable, even when there are documents to prove
	it?
	[Posted by arsfatima at 2008-05-29T11:43:22+00:00 - Side: No]

		Just because something is in a document doesn't mean that it is
		reliable. These documents have been written by people who are biased,
		who may take on a tone which causes the reader to be biased and not
		have a balanced view on what really occurred. Also, those who have
		written the document may not have the whole story, or information
		needed to have a complete overview of an event. Especially with
		Ancient history, the sources are limited and so we can only rely on
		ancient historians who have gathered their information through the
		testimony of others who had been witness to the event, or heard from
		someone else who had been witness to the event. Not exactly reliable.
		Just because something is written does not mean that it is true. One
		example is Roman history which was heavily biased. This can be seen in
		the actions of Octavian (Augustus Caesar) who used propaganda to put
		down one of his opponents - Sextus Pompeius - whilst discussing the
		other - Marc Antony - at great length. This resulted in a very poor
		image of Sextus, barely any mention of him in historical references,
		being accused of being a pirate and being cowardly, whilst Marc Antony
		was hailed. It's called censorship and politics. Nothing is truly
		reliable, not memories, not the documents that memories are made from.

The only benefit from a history class is to make good citizens.
History has taught us one thing, people do not learn from the past.

there is subverzive history-one writed by the Losers. Which one you

War is bed thing ,and that is something y don't need to learn, y can

history does have a value outside of academics, in a genral sort of
sense. you learn the basic notion of good and bad. but, the date and
fact that we are forced to learn are useless information. the only
time this information is used is if the job requires it or the person
is teaching history.

History is thought in schools for our kids to learn about the past
and all the great and not so great things that have shaped bout
society as we know it today.

This argument wholly depends on which type of history you are dealing
with. If you are talking about recent history, say, in the last ten
years, then it's completely pointless; who would desire to remember
the blunders that this country has experienced in the last decade?
However, if you are talking about older history, say, all of American
History, then there is still an inherent lack of application to
everyday society, unless of course you want to understand a few of Jon
Stewart's historical allusions. The prospect of "learning from our
mistakes" clearly hasn't registered, especially with those currently
in power (Dick Cheney during the first Bush presidency advising
against invading Iraq then invading Iraq during the second Bush
administration). If our leaders, check that, if world leaders aren't
learning from "past mistakes," how is history actually applicable to
the average American?

Ok so the teachers talk about how this class will help you make
decisions better and so we don't go to the past. like all of the
dictator leaders. (I don't have anything against them) Well, am i ever
going to be the leader of The USA or China, Germany, England, or
Africa?! No! I don't see a job that needs the subject history in it.
Unless your job doesn't matter. like some bone digger. No Offense to

I dont think that history is really needed, since you dont need it in
future jobs. I think that history is just there to just fill in the
gap in schedules and they dont want the classes to long. If you want
to work in a place where your surrounded in historical items then i
understand but i doubt that will barely happen in life. I know that
history is just there to teach people on how they lived, what they
did, and what happened back then, but there ain't anything in history
that can help us now in future careers.

	You are completely missing the point of history. Perhaps because
	youve been exposed to history in a negative light. I agree with you in
	the sense knowing about what historical objects were significant to
	what people and when is just plain useless. Dates wont get you
	anywhere. But there is SO much more to history than dates. With
	history you learn about what significant people have done before you
	and what that resulted in. It serves to help you develop as a person.
	What if another tyrant like Hitler were to take power again? What if
	your parents were killed just because they opposed the tyrant? What
	would life be like? Imagine being forced to work for something you
	dont want to work for just because the tyrant thinks it is beneficial
	for strengthening his grip on society? Dont you wish at that point in
	time you studied what the tyrant was doing before he came to power,
	and wish that you could do something to prevent it? And wouldnt you
	wish others would have done something to stop it? If you wish to
	prevent catastrophes like the above from happening, how are you going
	to know about what the tyrant is doing to get into power if you dont
	even have any examples to learn from? History is the most powerful
	tool Man has to learn and to progress. Perhaps you have not reached
	that stage where life would mean more than studying to get a job yet.
	You might change your mind when the time comes. But yeah I agree,
	dates suck!

	Lots of people get by every day without a lick of exercise, too, but
	that doesn't mean that exercise has no value outside of professional
	sports. Studying history (real study and reflection, not just names
	and dates) helps us understand how events are connected, how certain
	beliefs and attitudes came about, and how the past continues to shape
	current events. Can a lot of people get by without studying history?
	Of course. Would they derive value from it anyway? I think so.

Best question I've seen around here so far, dusted with cliche and
self-justifying statements I heard back in grade school, no dignity
for whatever that is closer to reality, rather to ideals of some
delusional progression - the hypnotizing 'Betterment' myth of modern
stamen march. "History as a path to the future" - without history we
are future less. This statement here acquires the simple task of
learning by experience, trial and error technique, for a whole, of an
organized society, which should collectively punish itself for
declared facts of it's own acts of supporting a cause or a belief, to
give birth to individual guilt, enlightened responsibility and modern
passiveness. An impotent self-depressant whole in which the right is
much radically opposed to the left. In fact, Democrats and Republicans
have different histories or at least a varied set of interpretations
of whatever 'really' happened. There is no progress, politically
speaking, only consequences. Individually, gear-less manual-less
histories of social survivalism. "We should learn from our mistakes to
ensure success \ never repeat them" - With sufficient information, we
would one day figure out the truly right way to do pretty much
everything. Can't argue with utopian absolutism, eh? This one quickly
presents the act, whether it is a universal, a political or even a
frequent act like milk pouring as rather right or wrong, very binary,
very I'm under surveillance 24\7 and the sun still orbits around the
invisible energies of good and evil. Mistakes are not evil, if one
insists of embracing these hazy notions as the existence of 'mistakes'
and 'evil', one shouldn't fear his hazy creations, their existence
feed his desire of their contrasts, which morphs everything into the
'right' and 'good', while neglecting any necessity for all four of
these useless notions. "History has value outside of academy in the
form of exchange-value" - Maybe my usage of the 'exchange value' is
not correct, but I believe that in a situation such as your boss
asking you to write an article about something in relation to WWII,
you would have your knowledge of history as a relief. But stating that
a situation like that values and justifies history is like saying that
celebrity specialization is much more important.

know about it

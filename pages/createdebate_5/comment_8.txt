Comments:

Jackson should be on the $20 dollar because he did many great things
to benefit the U.S.
[Posted by freemanlt at 2014-11-12T18:20:21+00:00 - Side: Yes]

	He did not benefit the US. He caused the US to go into a depression.
	[Posted by Jacksonzn at 2014-11-12T18:22:14+00:00 - Side: No]

		He did what the people wanted. It wasn't entirely his fault that we
		went into a depression. The people wanted a National Bank so he made
		it happen.
		[Posted by browncn at 2014-11-12T18:23:40+00:00 - Side: Yes]

			The people did not want the national bank so yeah I guess its not all
			his fault, but the only reason he actually vetoed it is because they
			had told him if he didn't he wouldn't win the next election.
			[Posted by Jacksonzn at 2014-11-12T18:38:29+00:00 - Side: No]

				He did what he had to do to to benefit his people and he did, it just
				back fired.
				[Posted by browncn at 2014-11-12T18:40:35+00:00 - Side: Yes]

			Jackson refused to recharter the National Bank, he didn't help them
			get it.

		The longest one in US History. This is for the 50 characters

			Well, what's the job of the government? To do what the people want,
			or to do what they think is best for the people? It's a
			[representative] democracy, so the answer to that should be easy. Once
			the government thinks its job is to tell us what's best for us, we're
			effectively North Korea...

	He was not because he ordered his workers to whip his slaves if they
	didn't do enough work which is wrong.
	[Posted by hunikejm at 2014-11-12T18:22:50+00:00 - Side: No]

		That may be wrong from our stand point from this day in age, but you
		have to remember that that was the norm of his time. It's like when we
		were young we had webkins they were cool. Then it was cool to have
		fake feathers in our hair. In the 1800's it was cool to have slaves.
		It was the thing to have and he, being a man of authority had slaves.
		Him having slaves had no affect on his ability to be a great
		president.
		[Posted by browncn at 2014-11-12T18:30:25+00:00 - Side: Yes]

			Okay, but even if that's right, what about how he reacting to the
			crisis, the acts, and the tariffs? His actions with the National Bank.
			All those things lead up to the reason why he's not the best
			president. His actions spoke louder than his words.
			[Posted by huffse at 2014-11-13T18:00:09+00:00 - Side: No]

			As a president, you are representing your country. For a little bit,
			the norm of this country was to make fun of gay people, but did that
			make it morally right? Same applies to the Natives. Jackson was the
			man who gave birth to American Terrorism. America is commonly referred
			to as "the Mother of All Terrorism." This is because we do what we
			want when we want to do it, regardless of what others may believe. The
			Natives were most likely terrified and hated all American people after
			the Trail of Tears. We as a country have no consideration for others.
			[Posted by AlanH at 2014-11-13T18:16:57+00:00 - Side: No]

		basically every president before him had slaves just sayin' not
		saying its right though
		[Posted by burnettedf at 2014-11-13T18:12:44+00:00 - Side: Yes]

			Yes they had slaves, and probably traded them as well. But adding the
			indian 'problem' to his slave trading. made him seem like he has no
			heart. He made both groups lives miserable. And helped his white males
			in the north only.
			[Posted by Brandlm at 2014-11-13T18:20:18+00:00 - Side: No]

	He also did many terrible things and handled things completely
	irrationally. For example, after the court ruled that native americans
	could stay where they were, he went on a removed them and made them
	walk long distances and a lot of them died.
	[Posted by browntm1 at 2014-11-12T18:24:51+00:00 - Side: No]

		That also is something that is seen as wrong to us because we know
		the end result. He was trying to help his people and give them a home
		they could be proud of and the Natives, being the black sheep of their
		nation, were soiling the land they called home. Also how was he
		supposed to know that many of them would die? He didn't have a magic
		ball, he could see the future!
		[Posted by browncn at 2014-11-12T18:38:08+00:00 - Side: Yes]

			He went against the Supreme Court's ruling. That's not something you
			should do. And he didn't care what would happen to them, or else he
			wouldn't have made them walk hundreds of miles in winter.
			[Posted by heyme at 2014-11-12T18:40:54+00:00 - Side: No]

				How else would they have gotten there? They had to walk there was no
				other way. Granted he could have waited for it to warm up but also
				remember most white people didn't see the Natives as people. Very few
				gave them the time of day. They were seen as cattle and treated as so,
				so they moved them like cattle.
				[Posted by browncn at 2014-11-12T18:56:35+00:00 - Side: Yes]

			He wasn't trying to give them a home they could be proud of. They
			already had one, and were living on it peacefully until Jackson
			dismissed the court ruling and forced them to go somewhere else just
			because he wanted their land.
			[Posted by heyme at 2014-11-13T18:08:05+00:00 - Side: No]

			Regardless of whether he meant for them to die on the journey to the
			promised land, he was still ordered not to follow through on this. The
			death of thousands of people could have been prevented if he would
			have done his job. There was land that was still untouched in the
			Louisiana Purchase that his people could have lived on and been proud
			of.
			[Posted by Zoeklewis at 2014-11-13T18:08:10+00:00 - Side: No]

		I agree with Taylor, not only was it irrational, but it was illegal.
		When people break the law they are punished in some way, right?
		Jackson broke the law and he was rewarded by having his face put on a
		$20 bill. I don't think that he should be on there. He should have
		been punished.
		[Posted by Zoeklewis at 2014-11-13T18:03:24+00:00 - Side: Yes]

			Jackson was not rewarded nor punished but he was respected, because
			he was persistent and people see that as a good quality in a leader.
			[Posted by rojasi at 2014-11-14T03:35:39+00:00 - Side: No]

	Jackson also did many things that harmed the U.S. more than helped.
	Jackson was not thinking of everyone when he made decisions. He was
	careless and power-hungry. His methods were violent and unnecessary.
	[Posted by browntm1 at 2014-11-12T18:32:41+00:00 - Side: No]

		We love to talk about the many bad things he did, but what about the
		Good that he's done for the country? Did you know that Andrew Jackson
		fought for our country, and was respected amongst many? He was the
		president, there are going to be things he's done wrong, I mean he had
		the weight on his shoulders.
		[Posted by ariyonamcm at 2014-11-15T13:58:05+00:00 - Side: No]

	He did more things that hurt the US than things that benefited them.
	[Posted by heyme at 2014-11-12T18:25:47+00:00 - Side: No]

		Do you have examples because I think he did much more to benefit the
		US then hurt us.
		[Posted by browncn at 2014-11-12T18:41:50+00:00 - Side: Yes]

	He did more things that would hurt the US rather than to benefit them
	[Posted by MakailaMS at 2014-11-12T18:55:01+00:00 - Side: No]

		That's what you say but I see many great things he did for America.
		He got rid of national debt, gave his people more land for food and
		stood up for what they wanted in government. There may have been some
		bumps and bruises along the way but he still did his best. He tried
		and sometimes when you try you mess up but when he did he tried to fix
		it. When the tariffs were too high for the south he passed a new one
		that was lower. He did what he thought was best as president.
		[Posted by LydiaCone at 2014-11-13T18:12:22+00:00 - Side: Yes]

Jackson actually got rid of the national debt, which no other
president did!
[Posted by freemanlt at 2014-11-12T18:33:40+00:00 - Side: Yes]

	It was only for a period of time though. It's not like he got
	completely rid of it
	[Posted by MakailaMS at 2014-11-12T18:56:33+00:00 - Side: No]

		But he tried. How many other presidents have worked that hard to get
		rid of the National debt and succeeded? He did everything he could to
		get rid of it. It got messed up after that and that's not his fault.
		Time has gone on and some presidents work to get rid of the national
		debt and others don't but it's not the presidents that tried fault
		because at least they tried. Jackson tried and succeeded.
		[Posted by LydiaCone at 2014-11-13T18:04:26+00:00 - Side: Yes]

		No one can ever completely get rid of debt because the government
		always has to play for certain things. He came closer than any other
		president to getting rid of the debt.
		[Posted by petersag at 2014-11-13T18:07:34+00:00 - Side: Yes]

		even if it was for only a short amount of time at least he proved it
		could be done and he worked hard until it was done
		[Posted by Parrishtm at 2014-11-13T18:08:56+00:00 - Side: Yes]

		He did a lot more than some presidents can say. A period of time you
		say, but that's longer than some. One cannot simply point out the bad
		he's done, without siding it with the good.
		[Posted by ariyonamcm at 2014-11-15T14:00:22+00:00 - Side: Yes]

		The debt came back and is bigger than ever. His decisions that made
		the debt go away, later caused massive downfalls, which caused even
		more debt.
		[Posted by Zoeklewis at 2014-11-13T18:05:25+00:00 - Side: Yes]

	Getting rid of National Debt is close to impossible. Jackson lessened
	the debt a bit until the end up his presidency, and the debt came back
	in full force causing the nation to go into depression
	[Posted by heyme at 2014-11-13T18:10:49+00:00 - Side: No]

		If it was at the end of his presidency that the debt went up then how
		is that his fault? He did what he could for the time being and yes,
		the debt is almost impossible to get rid of which is why its amazing
		that he was able to get rid of it for the short amount of time that he
		had.
		[Posted by LydiaCone at 2014-11-13T18:15:00+00:00 - Side: Yes]

Jackson should be on the $20 dollar bill, due to the dedication he
put into the country. He did everything he could, to support the
country, even if it meant some suffered, he made sure the majority did
not.
[Posted by ariyonamcm at 2014-11-12T18:22:26+00:00 - Side: Yes]

	He made so many suffer including the native americans. Looking at all
	that he did, he didn't care about who he was hurting.
	[Posted by browntm1 at 2014-11-12T18:28:35+00:00 - Side: No]

		How can you say the President was not thinking about everyone else,
		when he was trying to support the country? Many suffered, however
		Jackson worked hard to ensure that not Everyone suffered. Im not
		saying that his way of handling things were the best, and his views on
		indians were not justified, however he did support the country, and
		tried his best to do what was right. You make him sound like a
		dictator
		[Posted by ariyonamcm at 2014-11-12T18:32:49+00:00 - Side: Yes]

Andrew Jackson was a very strong man. He did everything he needed to
and didn't worry about what people had to say about it. He knew that
what he was doing was best for the country.
[Posted by petersag at 2014-11-12T18:34:00+00:00 - Side: Yes]

Jackson should be on the $20 bill because he was a war hero who
people can look up to and he even stopped national debt at one point
in time. He was very relatable.
[Posted by hatcherzj at 2014-11-12T18:20:49+00:00 - Side: Yes]

	He was relatable before he went through with the indian removal act.
	Now that we know all that he did, he is no longer relatable unless you
	agree with killing lots of people and forcing them to walk through
	horrible weather. He was a great war hero because he was violent and
	ruthless and these were not good qualities as a president.
	[Posted by browntm1 at 2014-11-12T18:30:53+00:00 - Side: No]

		No he was relatable because he did good things for our country and
		showed interest in the people . He put the Indians out because he felt
		it was good for our country. A part of being a good president is being
		able to make hard decisions.
		[Posted by hatcherzj at 2014-11-12T18:39:11+00:00 - Side: Yes]

			Not everyone supported the indian removal act though. This made us
			look bad as a nation. It did not help everyone. In my eyes this was
			not good or moral.
			[Posted by browntm1 at 2014-11-12T18:45:25+00:00 - Side: No]

				People would probably do the same today to immigrants just because it
				will help us as a country.
				[Posted by trivettbb at 2014-11-13T18:16:41+00:00 - Side: Yes]

			When you become a president, part of your job is to represent the
			country. Putting the Native Americans out and the fact that so many of
			them died did not make the U.S. look good. He did not even have the
			right to remove them, so it was illegal.
			[Posted by browntm1 at 2014-11-13T18:14:27+00:00 - Side: No]

		Although the Indian Removal Act was not exactly ethical, you cannot
		say that Jackson knew that thousands would die. And it was wrong that
		he went against the courts to abide by his own wishes, however he only
		did what he thought was best for the country. The Indians being
		removed and placed into a different area, may have been what was best
		for the country at the time. The end results were indeed tragic, and I
		sympathize, but Jackson saw that it had to be done..so it had to be
		done.
		[Posted by ariyonamcm at 2014-11-15T14:06:20+00:00 - Side: Yes]

	He was a war hero yet he didnt care about slaves lives when he traded
	them to other people. He didnt care about the lives of indians when he
	forced them to move. I do not want to look up to a man who put
	civilian lives on the line just for the good of himself
	[Posted by Brandlm at 2014-11-12T18:36:32+00:00 - Side: No]

		Good of himself? Or good of the country? We needed the land. Hard
		decisions had to be made. Also slaves, well no one viewed blacks as
		equal. This definitely wasn't right but that was the way they
		thought... everyone pretty much. So still he was representing the
		people.
		[Posted by hatcherzj at 2014-11-12T18:45:15+00:00 - Side: Yes]

		It was for the good of his people not himself. He gave them more
		space to call home. Yes he took it from the Natives which I don't
		think is right but during that time most people hated Native Americans
		and saw them as inferior beings.
		[Posted by browncn at 2014-11-12T18:53:56+00:00 - Side: Yes]

		Yeah, how was this for the good of himself? He did it for the people.
		[Posted by trivettbb at 2014-11-13T18:09:19+00:00 - Side: Yes]

		Back then, black people were not viewed as people. This was the way
		things were before Jackson even came into office. As for the indians,
		the people saw them as un-trust worthy after the incident in which
		they supported and helped the British during the American Revolution.
		Im not saying this was all indians. merely a select few, but like most
		stereotypical and prejudice people in this country...they judge by
		what only SOME people did. Jackson, like most presidents, was abiding
		by the interests and trying to relate to his supporters as much as he
		could. Wrong? Sure! Unethical? Of course! But it is what a lot of
		presidents do today. We went over this in class...they relate to their
		supporters.
		[Posted by ariyonamcm at 2014-11-15T14:14:50+00:00 - Side: Yes]

	He could relate to the average American man. That's why he was a good
	voice for the people during his presidency.
	[Posted by petersag at 2014-11-12T18:51:52+00:00 - Side: Yes]

	He only stopped the debt for a short period of time. The debt
	eventually came right back and sent us into depression
	[Posted by heyme at 2014-11-12T18:27:40+00:00 - Side: No]

		That isn't solely based on Andrew Jackson. Andrew supported and
		expanded the U.S government that may or may not have failed, it's
		based off of opinion. It wasn't JUST Andrew Jackson's fault we went
		into a depression. He did what was right for the country at the time.
		[Posted by madij33 at 2014-11-12T18:32:23+00:00 - Side: Yes]

		That's not his fault. He wasn't even President when that happened so
		he did what he could. He got rid of the debt and just because someone
		else screwed that up doesn't make him a bad president.
		[Posted by LydiaCone at 2014-11-12T18:32:28+00:00 - Side: Yes]

		He did the best that he could. It wasn't necessarily his fault.
		[Posted by hatcherzj at 2014-11-12T18:36:19+00:00 - Side: Yes]

		The debt came back once he was out of office. So that was not his
		fault. He helped while he was in office.
		[Posted by trivettbb at 2014-11-12T18:45:06+00:00 - Side: Yes]

			The debt wouldn't have come back as fast if he would've kept the
			National Bank.
			[Posted by heyme at 2014-11-13T18:00:48+00:00 - Side: No]

		But he did stop it which no other president has done. and now for the
		big 5-0
		[Posted by browncn at 2014-11-12T18:49:33+00:00 - Side: Yes]

		The debt wasn't all his fault he was doing he he believed was best
		for the country at the time. He never intended to put us in the
		situation.
		[Posted by Daniel_T at 2014-11-18T00:28:25+00:00 - Side: Yes]

Jackson deserves to be on the $20 bill because he expanded our
country to what it is today. During his presidency he doubled the size
of the United States.
[Posted by womblejt at 2014-11-12T18:21:10+00:00 - Side: Yes]

	He was only able to double the size because he forced thousands of
	indians out of their land.
	[Posted by heyme at 2014-11-12T18:30:03+00:00 - Side: No]

		BUT we needed this land for farming. He kept the people alive,
		because of this decision.
		[Posted by trivettbb at 2014-11-12T18:47:22+00:00 - Side: Yes]

			we need some land we could have used the land that the native
			american did not live on or ask them to join us in america. unlike
			jackson who should not be on the $20 we should not kill them for
			liveing there.
			[Posted by nealnm at 2014-11-13T17:58:59+00:00 - Side: No]

			We could've got land from somewhere else. The Indians weren't harming
			us. There was plenty more land out there that we could've got.
			[Posted by heyme at 2014-11-13T18:03:21+00:00 - Side: No]

	The only way he expanded the country is by scalping Native Americans
	and forcing them out of their homeland during the winter.
	[Posted by Jacksonzn at 2014-11-12T18:23:33+00:00 - Side: No]

		When Jackson removed the Native Americans he relocated them into a
		new area. He had a place for them to live. He relocated them so that
		he can expand our country.
		[Posted by womblejt at 2014-11-12T18:28:57+00:00 - Side: Yes]

			But he made them walk in the freezing cold knowing that they did not
			have good shoes or clothes to keep them warm.
			[Posted by Jacksonzn at 2014-11-12T18:31:41+00:00 - Side: No]

		Yeah he did and he did it for the good sake of the place that you
		live in today.
		[Posted by Daniel_T at 2014-11-18T00:26:44+00:00 - Side: Yes]

			But who's to say that we wouldn't be living here today without him
			doing the things he did?
			[Posted by Jacksonzn at 2014-12-10T17:38:20+00:00 - Side: No]

	He expanded this country by killing indians and making thousands of
	indians move to different places.
	[Posted by hunikejm at 2014-11-12T18:25:14+00:00 - Side: No]

		He also moved them to their own land where someone can't come to take
		their land. He gave them a for sure home that no one could dispute.
		[Posted by madij33 at 2014-11-12T18:30:02+00:00 - Side: Yes]

			But your moving them from there sacred grounds and putting them in a
			completely different place and he moved them during the winter.
			[Posted by hunikejm at 2014-11-12T18:49:45+00:00 - Side: No]

				Would the summer have been any better? Then everyone would have been
				complaining about them dying of heat stroke.
				[Posted by madij33 at 2014-11-12T18:50:41+00:00 - Side: Yes]

					Yes it would have been better because they could get water on the way
					which was not actually frozen and they could actually not freeze to
					death so it would have been much better.
					[Posted by hunikejm at 2014-11-12T18:53:00+00:00 - Side: No]

						Oh so dried up rivers and heat strokes is better than ice and
						hypothermia. The same amount of people would have died.
						[Posted by madij33 at 2014-11-12T18:54:26+00:00 - Side: Yes]

			They were already on their own land. He could've just left them on
			their land which they considered sacred. Jackson could've got land
			from somewhere else. He didn't HAVE to move the Indians.
			[Posted by heyme at 2014-11-12T18:54:23+00:00 - Side: No]

	The Louisiana Purchase was in 1803. This purchase doubled the size of
	the US. Jackson did not become president until 1828.
	[Posted by Zoeklewis at 2014-11-12T18:32:18+00:00 - Side: No]

	Jackson didn't double the size of the US. The Louisiana Purchase did,
	which came before Jackson's time as president. He didn't even double
	to size of land we used that was owned. If you're going to commit acts
	of genocide to increase the size of actively used land, you might as
	well double the size of it, and not settle for a 1/4 increase
	[Posted by AlanH at 2014-11-12T18:46:28+00:00 - Side: No]

		who ever said it was an act of genocide that's a strong word
		[Posted by burnettedf at 2014-11-12T18:50:10+00:00 - Side: Yes]

			Yeah, we need to be careful with that word. Genocide is when you
			intentionally try to kill an entire race of people. Jackson just
			relocated them. It's not the first time in history a group of people
			were forcefully relocated.
			[Posted by MrOKeefe at 2014-11-12T18:57:52+00:00 - Side: Yes]

			well jackson was trying to move the native americans when killed a
			lot of them and made him look bad he was told not to move them and he
			did
			[Posted by nealnm at 2014-11-13T18:01:53+00:00 - Side: No]

President Jackson should be on the 20 dollar bill because he was a
man of the people and he was also a war hero
[Posted by underwoodhm at 2014-11-12T18:21:37+00:00 - Side: Yes]

	He wasn't a man of the people if he didn't support everyone but
	himself and his supporters
	[Posted by MakailaMS at 2014-11-12T18:22:46+00:00 - Side: No]

		One man can not appeal to the whole country Jackson supported the
		popular vote which was from the westerners and southerners.
		[Posted by womblejt at 2014-11-12T18:30:09+00:00 - Side: Yes]

		the other, which made it harder for the states to compromise when it

Andrew Jackson doesn't deserve to be on the $20 dollar bill because
he has done some cruel and disrespectful things. For example he was
the one who caused the Trail of Tears. He wanted the Cherokees off
their land so he can give it to the settlers and farmers and the
government wanted them off as well because they found gold. He also
wanted other tribes off their land and which were relocated to The
Indian Territory. The Cherokees took their case to court and the court
said they didn't have to move off their land but Andrew being a
selfish human being he forced them anyways which was unconstitutional.
The Cherokees moved off their land and walked in Harsh weather.

I don't believe that Andrew Jackson deserves to be on the 20 dollar
bill. All he is really well known for is for forcibly removing the
Native Americans so that he could take their land and destroying the
bank. Before he was President, he fought in many battles, like the
Battle of Horseshoe Bend and the Battle of New Orleans. As President,
he signed the Indian Removal Act, which forced many of the remaining
tribes of Native Americans off their land into Oklahoma. When the
Cherokee went to court to fight for their freedom non-violently,
Jackson still forced them off their territory after the Supreme Court
won the case. His famous words were, "John Marshall has made his
decision; now let him enforce it!". People voted for Andrew Jackson
because they thought it would be good to have a representative of "the
common people". Though he had fought many battles and was greatly
respected by some, he wasn't an appropriate choice for president. The
President shouldn't be someone who fires all of his workers just
because they don't agree with them, and they shouldn't react to every
argument by screaming and yelling just so they can feel empowered.
Andrew Jackson also promised to give more opportunities to the common
people, and he saw the Second Bank of the United States as the main
threat to their way of life. So Jackson gets to work to destroy the
bank, which leads to a drop in economy and makes life harder for the
common people he said he was going to help. So in general I don't
believe that Andrew Jackson should be on our 20 dollar bill. I
wouldn't want to remember the temperamental man who killed thousands
of Native Americans over land whenever i use a 20 bill.

		Removing the Native Americans from their land was not the best thing
		for America.

			In Andrew Jackson's eyes it was though. He thought moving the Native
			Americans to a secluded area where they could have their own land
			would benefit everyone.

				It is true that Jackson provided new land for American, but it was

			removing the natives gave us move land and we made them states that

		Taylor is exactly right. What he did was the best for America and it
		helped the economy.

			It gave more land to americans. All I'm saying is that Jackson could

	If you had the choice to fight for the people you govern or just let
	them suffer for the good of other people what would you do? He did
	what he needed to give the Americans what they needed. He gave them
	land they needed to grow food that they could've died without. I don't
	see that as being a bad President. He was making sure he took care of
	his country first.
	[Posted by LydiaCone at 2014-11-12T18:27:41+00:00 - Side: Yes]

		That is very true. To grow the amount of food that our expanding
		country needed, we needed more land.
		[Posted by petersag at 2014-11-12T18:41:21+00:00 - Side: Yes]

			But was it okay that he practically forced the Indians to give up
			their lands? Was it right to take them away from their home?

	He gave americans more land by removing the natives americans
	[Posted by isaacsaleh at 2014-11-12T18:32:00+00:00 - Side: Yes]

		It is true that he gave americans more land, but the way he did it
		was very cruel and cold-hearted.
		[Posted by Tapiao at 2014-11-12T18:37:31+00:00 - Side: No]

			He didn't know the outcome of his actions. He had the right idea it
			was just poorly executed.
			[Posted by browncn at 2014-11-12T18:39:31+00:00 - Side: Yes]

			In whose eyes? He did what he thought was necessary and it wasn't his
			fault the Indians died. They could have prepared or brought things
			with them that could have acclimated them to the cold weather. He
			didn't know they would die. He was trying to get more land to feed the
			rapidly growing American population
			[Posted by madij33 at 2014-11-12T18:48:29+00:00 - Side: Yes]

			There was no other way that Jackson could have done it. At least the
			Americans gained more land for crops.
			[Posted by mikaelawade at 2014-11-12T18:49:15+00:00 - Side: Yes]

				There were other ways. He could have moved the Natives in a good way
				rather than being cruel.
				[Posted by Tapiao at 2014-11-12T18:55:15+00:00 - Side: No]

					His actions are barely cruel. He was moving the Native Americans to a
					secure location. And there was no other way to get them there.
					[Posted by madij33 at 2014-11-12T18:56:23+00:00 - Side: Yes]

			That was the only was to do it because if he didn't do what he done
			the native would probably wanted to fight
			[Posted by isaacsaleh at 2014-11-12T18:53:36+00:00 - Side: Yes]

			When he removed the Native he did not kick them out of america he
			just relocated them so that Americans could put their land to good
			use.

	Look at all the good things that he did during his presidency though.
	He helped the American people and was a in the government for them.
	[Posted by petersag at 2014-11-12T18:32:37+00:00 - Side: Yes]

		He did not help the people, he gave them what they wanted. He spoiled
		them pretty much. Nothing he did helped the people in the long run,
		except for fight in a war before he became president.

	everyone was cruel to the native Americans! they all owned slaves and
	treated them terribly. that was socially accepted back then
	[Posted by underwoodhm at 2014-11-12T18:32:53+00:00 - Side: Yes]

		Just because something is socially accepted does not make it okay to
		do. To many people I know (not applying to me), making fun of gay
		people is socially accepted, but does it make it right to do? Was it
		socially accepted to forcefully remove Natives from their home? Yes.
		But was it morally right? Just because they have a different skin
		color does not mean that their blood, bones, heart, lungs, and
		anything else is different. They are still human beings with beating
		hearts and life inside them.

			All of these things that you see as horrible and things that no man
			should ever do for any reason what so ever, but without him doing that
			and claiming the US as ours than it was just going to happen later.
			[Posted by Daniel_T at 2014-11-18T00:17:46+00:00 - Side: Yes]

	One action that he thought was right shouldn't justify his right to
	be on the $20 bill.

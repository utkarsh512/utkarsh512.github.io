Comments:

for narrow minded people think age of majority is 18+. We expect 17
year old to act mature, but we treat 17 year old like a child or
subhuman. 17 year old need to learn how to handle standard
responsibility. At 16 the brain tells them that they need adult
treatment. Treating 17 year old like kids, making them think is okay
to act inmature. This is why Grade 12 and 13 act inmature, most of
them act more inmature than their grade 9 self. because the high
school system treat 17 year old similiar way as 14-15 year olds.

heres a scenario What if a 16 year old guy grew up with his mental
ill parent. His parents and guardians are so abusive of him making his
life miserable. He move out at this age. nobody wanted to hire him or
give him place because of it. He has good grades, volunteer, but
cannot find work and homeless. He scrubs floors doing dishes for hours
to make a living. He wants to be self sufficient, successful instead
of live off with other people. He wants to move on with his life.
School lunches may be the only places he can get food. He work hard
for it, but he deserve less than he should deserve. The only way he
can get emancipated is by court, which teenager cannot afford Why
should someone unable to take care of themselves have responsibility
over the children. Teenager can work as hard as anybody else, who will
give youth a chance, no one. Why should someone unable to take care of
themselves have responsibility over the children. There are so many
youth suffering like him. No one knows about it until they are in that
situation. There got to be exception like him.

What the fuck does "age of majority" mean? I usually don't waste my
time chatting with first-timers, since I usually need somebody to
prove themselves as being worthy debaters before I spend my valuable
time giving them my various pearls of wisdom. So here is your
chance...............please explain. Thanks. SS

	Majority=when a person is no longer a Minor (HERP DERP
	SLAPSHOITEYTOY:P) Anywhoo.... No. it shouldn't be. Ideally, there
	shouldn't be a hard age of majority but instead should be a point in
	which they can make decisions and understand the full implications of
	their decisions. as a person who cannot do this at above the age of
	majority is in many cases considered Mentally ill (deficient) and
	receives specialized sentencing depending on the severity of the
	crime. and many people who are tried as adults below the age of
	majority were well aware what was going on, and understood that what
	they were doing was wrong.

				At 17 you can donate blood. They can donate organs too to save
				people's life. That is one of a big thing for late teens to do. 16
				year old is different to the 17 year old, because 16 year old are mid
				teens, while 17 is late teens. Age of consent is 16 in majority of
				countries in the world.

	age of majority means when children become legally an adult
	[Posted by Ledger17-24 at 2016-07-21T19:47:58+00:00 - Side: yes]

I think it's really going to depend on the situation. I don't think a
17 year old has more life experience that an 18 years old, not much
will be gained in that one year to really call someone an adult. But I
think in the event of crimes...hm. I don't know. I think if you commit
an "adult" crime such as first degree murder, then you probably should
be tried as an adult. But only if it's such a horrific thing as first
degree and really it has to depend on the reason. I know that is a
huge legal loophole and doesn't make much sense but ok well...in the
case of Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, though they were 10, their
crime was so horrific they should have been tried as an adult. There
are multiple cases of children and young adults who have committed
crimes so atrocious they shouldn't be handled with kid gloves, I just
can't stomach reading to point out more names. The age of enlisting
for the military is 18, at least in the US because that is the age of
adulthood, I'm not sure that should be lowered any more either.

	but some countries enlist 17 year old in the military. Average human

		But not the brain for it. The rational part of the teen's brain isn't
		fully developed until about 25 years old. Having the body of an adult
		means nothing if your mind isn't keeping up with rational thought.

			But the Temporal Lobe and Parietal Lobe is developed by age 16, at
			this point 17 year old needs adult treatment. The brain is at its
			adult mass by age 16-17. At this age they can make rational decision

				Language, mathematical skills, object orientation and identification,
				those are all great skills to have sure. However the part of the
				brain, the prefrontal cortex which is associate with managing emotion,
				planning, prioritizing, complex decision making is the last to fully
				develop, usually ending in the 20's. It's when that is developed that
				you have a better ability to regulate impulses and make better goal-
				oriented choices. Teens (early adults) limbic system isn't held in
				check by the benefits of the frontal lobe when they are that age.
				Decisions are made by impulse and emotion, not necessarily logic and
				sense. A brain at adult mass has no bearing on its ability to operate
				at full capacity.

					I know that, but making mistake is an important part of life. If
					early adults make mistake, they still learn something. Any age can
					make mistakes. The fact is age of majority is set to 18, but their
					brain is not fully developed until 25 like you said. During
					adolescence, they become increasingly sensitive to social cues.
					Sometimes these social cues are powerful enough to apply an emotional
					pull. What you described as a "quick temper" can and does happen to
					older adults also. It is called the "amygdala hijack," a term coined
					by Daniel Goleman. The amygdala is the emotional part of the brain,
					which regulates the "fight or flight response".

						It's not a matter of making a mistake. Even 98 year olds are capable
						of that. It's a matter of having a better capacity to make rational
						decision. There's a large difference in that. Yes, adults can have
						quick tempers, I'm part Irish, part Italian and German, I know all
						about it when I deal with it myself but again, it's a matter of having
						a better ability to not let that flash of anger guide what I do and
						have the sense to step back. Does it always happen? Pfff no. But I
						stand a better chance with full use of my faculties not to do
						something remarkably stupid just for instance gratification. Now out
						of curiosity, why would you want to be classified as an adult at an
						earlier age? What benefit would you get from this? Also, why would you
						want to be an enemy? I find your conversation fascinating and I
						respect your ability to have a debate without resorting to the common
						disrespect and snide comments so many people on here seem to fall in
						to.

							Also, I should point out that these emotional cues that you are
							talking about are just as prevalent in adults. It's not just teens
							that have to deal with social status, successes and the like, but when
							you can use sense and full rationality, those pressures fade over
							time. They exist but you are less likely to "give in to fit in".

							Do you realize that Germany's voting age is 16 in some elections,
							however 18 in federal elections. So lowering the age of majority will
							increase power an individual has, which empowers them. They can have
							control of their lives. If we expect 17 year old to act as an adult,
							then they will behave like an adult as long as we give them adult
							treatment. 16 year old is a drop out of school age in most countries.
							When they drop out they will have jobs and support their family. The
							reason to class as an adult at earlier age is we expect 17 year old to
							be act mature, but we treat them like a child is subhuman. Youth are
							oppressed. there are too many conflicts and rebellions between parents
							and child this has taken its toll both parent and teen/young adult
							child's lives. 17 year old can decide what to wear have an ability to
							express themselves. But younger children is difference they need
							guidance from their parents. And stop being adultism.

									If its a dangerous or life threatening situation is okay to yell. I'm
									not saying that parent should be friends with their kid. This is the
									reason why older teenagers are depressed nowadays because they are
									forced to be treated like kids. Every animals become an adult when
									they reach puberty. Age restriction only exist in humans seems to be
									unnatural. Age restriction does not exist in animals. I'm saying that
									17 year old need to class as an adult to have control of their life
									and have responsibilities. Parents are not perfect and no one is
									perfect. Yes that is one of the reason why I like 17 year old to be
									classified as an adult.

										Actually it MAY be one reason but it is certainly not a good reason
										nor a main reason why teens are depressed. You can't tell me a 17 year
										old is falling into depression because they can't vote on the next
										president or enlist in the military, and if they are they need to see
										a specialist because there is something else going on there. Teens
										having body issues isn't something that's new either. That's been
										around a LONG time so you don't have the market on it. What is new is
										the way those issues are out there online and in the media. You don't
										get body issues because you aren't treated as an adult, you get them
										because media, marketing campaigns, and people tell you that you have
										to be a certain way. There is body shaming all over the place, whether
										someone is too skinny or too fat or just right but there must be
										SOMETHING wrong with them somehow. A kid/teen doesn't get depressed
										just because they can't take a nude picture of themselves, honestly
										that is where the cause and effect portion of the brain and its
										underdevelopment in young/old teens comes into play. When you're older
										you know you probably shouldn't take that picture because you know it
										will get out there. Maybe a break up, maybe someone gets hacked, and
										POOF those pictures you took for a private moment are everyone's
										business. When animals are born they are able to move and develop MUCH
										faster then humans, they need that to be able to survive. Within weeks
										of a newborn kittens actual arrival in this world they are up and
										moving. It takes MONTHS for a human child to do it. Cats can become
										pregnant as early as 6 months old I believe. So you can't compare
										animals to humans in terms of puberty.

												That's a different thing all together as you well know. And again,

											The problem is the society ask 16-17 year old to make career
											decisions that is one of the big decision they can make, but they are
											still treated like kids, for example 17 year old raise their hand and
											ask the teacher if they can go to the washroom. 17 year old are forced
											to go to the assemblies, 17 year old has to ask their parents to call
											the school when 17 year old are feeling ill and not able to make it to
											school. They are capable of making phone calls for themselves. How
											silly that is. High School system treated 17 year old like a 14 year
											old. 14 year old is different from a 17 year old. 14 and 17 is the big
											difference. Even 16 and 17 year old is the big difference. 16 year old
											is the age they can apply for driving license in English Speaking
											countries. They are taking risk.

												I will agree with some of this. Yes sometimes a 16-17 year old, in
												the event of emergency circumstance such as going to the bathroom or
												taking care of a physical issue, should be able to go. In most
												instance teachers will allow them but if the teacher does not and that
												bathroom emergency is dire (Not just washing hands because they are
												dirty) then the student should be able to get up and go. Sometimes
												being an adult is making a decision that you'll have repercussions for
												but they are the best decision for you. If you find you need to wash
												your hands often during a class, make it a habit to bring baby wipes
												or something. You can apply for a learners permit at 15 in most states
												if not all which is a HUGE adult responsibility. You can get a job at
												16 in most states, also a huge responsibility. Do you think as you get
												older you get more privileges? Soon enough you'll have the
												responsibility of paying for college, paying rent, paying mortgage,
												and sacrificing wants vs. needs.
												[Posted by Mint_tea at 2016-07-24T17:54:32+00:00 - Side: yes]

													But having learners permit is more dangerous than making school
													related decisions, voting, getting a credit card, open a bank account
													or withdrawing money from bank account. Most countries in the world
													have legal driving age to 18 also which makes more sense, why 16 year
													old can get drivers license while the adult age is 18. 16-17 year old
													can make healthcare medical related decisions, but 16-17 year old
													can't make school related decisions.
													[Posted by Ledger17-24 at 2016-07-24T18:08:56+00:00 - Side: yes]

														It IS more dangerous, which is why you are allowed those freedoms
														only after passing tests and courses. It is allowing you to have some
														freedoms that a 14 year old will not get. The Doctor/Patient
														confidentiality is something that extends to you for privacy purposes
														to get a teen to open up to the Doctor especially if they can't open
														up to their parents. That is such a great thing especially in
														instances of abusive parents, it is an avenue for kids to get help.
														There are things in life you just have to do. Go to school, abide by
														their rules. Go get a job and abide by their rules. It sucks, and in
														many ways it encourages you to go into business for yourself which is
														GREAT but there are also many more responsibilities as well.
														[Posted by Mint_tea at 2016-07-24T18:45:22+00:00 - Side: no]

												Probably because most teens aren't mature enough to NOT abuse the
												privilege. I don't even think it's a matter of maturity but you know
												that it would be abused to all hell and back. It's not a matter of
												treating you like a kid, if it was you would have recess, play on the
												playground, have your parents come with you on field trips and have
												someone tie your shoes. Even with a job, you may be required to get a
												Doctor's note when you call out of work, this is not unusual and YEAH
												it sucks and is ridiculous but that's part of the job. We may even
												have jobs where if we don't come in on our time off because someone
												else calls out then we get written up too. Some jobs make you work
												overtime with no additional pay, some make you work on holidays. The
												point is, we all have to go through parts of life were we are looked
												after. You are just beginning to get a taste of freedom that I assure
												you will be taken away again when some of those adult responsibilities
												catch up with you.

									Yelling and spanking at child is an abuse. If parents do it they are
									going to yell back and think is okay to yell and be rude. This will

										Yelling and spanking are greatly different from beating and verbally
										abusing. HUGE differences. That is a debate for another forum though.
										It depends on what is being yelled and the reason why. Some kids learn
										better from spanking but again, that is always going to depend on the
										reason and the parent. Some think their kids learn better from a time
										out. Again, depends on how often the kid/teen does the exact same
										thing.
										[Posted by Mint_tea at 2016-07-24T22:30:17+00:00 - Side: no]

											I disagree, yelling is similar to spanking. Yelling hurts
											psychologically. This is a form of psychological abuse. Again if
											parents yells at their kids because their kids in danger that is the
											total different story. If parents yelling at their kids unnecessarily,
											they would frighten their children. A lot of teenager and children are
											scared of their parents. Parents brought fear and terror to the
											children. This is why teenager dislike their parent because of it.
											Parents are unjust in all history of humankind. Parents another job is
											to empower their kids, not making them feel inferior By the time when
											children becomes older teen or young adult they may have conflict with
											their peers, other people. So you have yell at your child before.
											Probably this may be one of the reason why your children might be
											afraid of you. I don't know if you have kids or not, I do not need to
											know.

												Do you think young teens need to be handled with kid gloves if
												yelling damages the kid/teens psyche so? You say you want to be
												treated like an adult, do you think adults don't yell at each other?
												When your parents yell at you are you yelling back? And I'm not saying
												this to be mean but it speaks loudly of someone simply complaining
												that life isn't fair. Well, life isn't fair. It just isn't. Saying
												something like "Parents are unjust in all history of humankind."
												That's a remarkably childish thing to say. Tell me, when you gain your
												objective of being legally classified as an adult are you going to be
												moving out of your parents home? Going to get a job? Pay rent, pay mtg
												if not rent, pay electric, pay for food, pay for transportation? I
												mean if you're 17 then surely you have a means of taking care of
												yourself. That may mean getting two or three jobs, but if you are
												about 16 I think, you can already do that. So you have some money
												saved up yes? My parents would yell at me if I did something wrong,
												some times I yelled back, some times I just sat there and faded out
												until whatever they were saying was over. I am and was by no means
												scared of them. NOW again I say this depending on the type of yelling.
												If it's verbally abusive (and not just yelling with you yelling back)
												that's one thing, if a teen is just whining that his parents are
												yelling at him/her then maybe they are still too young to be called an
												adult. Teens don't typically dislike their parents simply because they
												yell, they typically dislike their parents because they act like
												parents. As they should.

														be inferior, some are inexperienced maybe but that's wisdom vs.
														intelligence. I would recommend you act more like the adult you want
														to be and stop whining about life being unfair. If you don't like the
														rules that your parents place on you, get emancipated and learn what
														it's really like to be an adult. That may mean taking on more than one
														job to pay the bills while going to school and paying whomever you
														live with rent and utilities.

																		getting a job, paying your parents rent, paying the bills for your car
																		or mode of transportation, paying for your own schooling and
																		everything else save for voting and probably drinking alcohol and...oh
																		of course...your original complaint that you can't send nude pictures
																		or receive them. That right there speaks volumes. So, tough it up
																		buttercup, you're going to be told what to do and have
																		responsibilities regardless of your age. End of story.

																			I hope you are not calling me buttercup as an offense, seriously.

																				I would hardly consider buttercup an offensive word, it's a cute wee
																				flower. "Suck it up buttercup" is a saying that has been around for a
																				long while.

																		What you want is pretty much anarchy. Everyone has to abide by rules
																		and laws made up by the society they live in.

																Calling it "junk science" without knowing the science behind it is

																	I don't want anarchy this has nothing to do with anarchy.

																		"People should have to right to leave whoever and whenever and no one
																		should have the right to make up some arbitrary rules and force people
																		to obey them." That is what you said. You said that no one should have
																		the right to make up rules and force people to obey them. That means
																		you do not believe in the validity of the social contract which is the
																		foundation of society, and you are calling for a return to the state
																		of nature, in essence. Which is anarchy.

																		NO. THIS DOES HAVE RELATION WITH STUFF LIKE ANARCHY. ..........

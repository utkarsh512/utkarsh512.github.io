The Dow being this high is an example of "cooking the books". It
jumped because of stock buy-backs, is overinflated and has ballooned
the Debt. WE … will pay.

	AL the DUMMY speaks so let's revisit what AL said and these are it's
	words - I did better in the STOCK MARKET under the NIGGER OBAMA So
	STUPID can you make sense of the response you wrote ?????? The Dow
	being this high is an example of "cooking the books". It jumped
	because of stock buy-backs, is overinflated and has ballooned the
	Debt. WE … will pay. AL did you say that about your LOVED OBAMA and
	the STOCK MARKET ????? You FUCKIN IDIOTS could not keep a STORY
	straight if you had too !!!!!!!!!!

	The Dow being this high is an example of "cooking the books". No idea
	what you're talking about. It jumped because of stock buy-backs, is
	overinflated and has ballooned the Debt. Companies responding to
	market pressure by buying back debt and actually cleaning up their
	balance sheets doesn't support your narrative. WE … will pay. In what
	way? Do tell.

If a HIGHER DOW means Trump is doing good, what does a LOWER DOW
mean? That he's doing bad if it were a low DOW. Staying above 25,000
consistently is good. He's at 26,191. The record highest DOW in
history is 26,800. He simply moved from unbelievable down to still
fantastic.

	That he's doing bad if it were a low DOW. Staying above 25,000
	consistently is good. It is proof he's cooking the numbers instead of
	fixing the problems with the economy. Shut your lying mouth you boring
	Nazi idiot.

		It is proof he's cooking the numbers instead of fixing the problems
		with the economy. * Seeing that Trump doesn't come up with these
		numbers, explain to us how he "cooks the numbers". Then explain why
		the leftist media accepts said numbers with no rebuke. instead of
		fixing the problems with the economy. Explain to us what the problems
		are with the economy. Shut your lying mouth you boring Nazi idiot.
		Nothing left in the chamber is there nom? Jolly good.

He's the mainstream media's long lost twin brother. Same nonsense
clothed in red rather than blue.

I think if you can show evidence that he is what you say he is, then
I would probably believe you. At the moment, I am inclined to believe
that he i just a normal person who just wants the truth to be told to
the people

	He’s a liar. He is playing a character as a performance artist for no
	other principle than profit on the premise that bullshit sells.

		I'm sure his lawyer is credible and as such, I'll take what he says
		into account. However, I don't think one person is enough to justify
		your premise that Alex jones is not to be trusted

			His lawyer is legally his own voice in the court of law. Jones’s
			lawyer cannot speak on his behalf without his approval. Jones may as
			well have said it himself.

				I didn't say it had to be specifically had to be his own lawyer. If
				he says other stuff, I'd like to see it but if other people are saying
				similar things I'd also like to see that

					I didn't say it had to be specifically had to be his own lawyer I
					don’t know that it had to be his own lawyer, but incidentally, it was
					his own lawyer.

						I apologize. I don't think I was clear earlier. I wanted more than
						just his lawyer to say something about him. Find me more people that
						make the claim you do and I probably might believe you

	add to the conversation.

Alex Jones and Van Jones are they one in the same as their mentality
is concerned.

Oh, he's definitely a mad man. That's part of his appeal, isn't it? I
think he performs a valuable service. He also lives in Austin, Texas.
He fits right in there. Austin is weird.

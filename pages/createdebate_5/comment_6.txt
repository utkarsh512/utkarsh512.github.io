The National Endowment for the Arts is a wonderful organization that
enriches our lives. Why shouldn't our Government endow them to further
their cause of bringing beauty, culture, film and dance to all people.
Without some needed funding from our Government the NEA would not be
able to bring so many of the arts right into our livingrooms through
PBS and affiliated stations.

be better.art helps a lot.it can be an artefact,it can make you
relax.we have many talents out here but not all are able to show it as
they have not enough money,so THE GOVERNMENT NEED TO FUND ARTS

sports,so why not arts men??nothing wrong with it,u are just giving
the poor chances

Art and beauty are an important part of culture, society, life and
just being human.

	but,yeah.we need arts.you see,arts are very useful.imagine london
	without any art,no foreigner will go there,for no fascinating sight is
	there

	That doesn't justify you taking my money for art. You don't need to
	take my money for "culture, society, life and just being human."

You have no right to spend money I worked hard to earn to buy pretty
things for yourself. Don't even pretend it is for me or that I
benefit. If I wanted it, I would have payed for it.

	you got choice to buy it or not.the sight of it can fascinate
	you.historians will definitely benefit from these and could make them
	as artefacts

People will pay for good art; government subsidies are unnecessary.
If art is good enough, then people will pay for it. If art is not good
enough to be popular, then government should not reward it for its
failure. If people have terrible taste, and no one is buying good art,
its not the government's job to be smarter than all the individuals on
the planet, figure out what is really good art, and subsidize it.

We are 15 trillion dollars in debt. We have to start making choices.
We should only spend money on vitally important things: things that
are worth borrowing money from China to pay for. When we can't make
our commitments to children's health, education, and other life or
other death maters. The arts are wonderful, and important, but we
don't live in a world where we can pretend that we don't need to make
choices.

	but,you see.sports are also funded by the government,i agree we need
	to make choice,but art can actually help you

The federal government should follow the 10th amendment which only
gives it powers to do certain things, and gives the states the power
to do EVERYTHING else, and so I'm not sure which "government" you are
talking about, but I assume you are talking about the federal
government...

Its not the government's job to be smarter than art consumers, and
fund TRUE art that is not appreciated. This assumes that no one but
the person getting the government money is smart enough to appreciate
the truly innovative art... We have billions of dollars buying
millions of pieces of innovative crap... If you don't think boundaries
are being pushed enough, then you are the last person who should be
getting more government money. Just as governments have proved to be
very poor at centrally-directed economic planning, they are unlikely
to be any better at centrally-directed artistic planning. If artists
and companies become dependent upon funding, they will react to the
implicit threat of its removal should they be too critical of the
government

If I were a Puerto Rican, I would prefer to remain a commonwealth of
the United States. Commonwealth status seems to carry most of the
advantages of being a state, without the disadvantages of being
entirely Independent.

	I completely agree, plus they don't have to pay federal income taxes.

	Puerto Rico should neither be a state nor independent. It should
	remain a commonwealth of the U.S. However, that option was not
	available.... so I had to post under Bohemian. ;)

wonderful thing to witness!!!!!

I don't have much of an opinion on this, I just thought it would be
interesting to see what people thought.... Considering the direction
Obama is taking the country I can't imagine many Puerto Ricans wanting
to join the union as a state.

	With the direction he's taking the country, I may consider going to
	Puerto Rico. I need to brush up on my Spanish, though.

Here is the problem with Puerto Rico, it would be great to see them
become completely independent but lets face it they can't stand alone.
Without the support of the US. Puerto Rico ......Wepaaaaaaaaaaaaa

Puerto Ricans are the most proud people I know and I have absolutely
no idea why. We have a lot of Puerto Ricans living here in Florida,
and just about every single one that I have ever met brags about their
heritage more than anyone else. Some of my closest friends are Puerto
Rican and talking about any type of heritage or culture or anything
like that around them is a huge mistake. They'll start ranting about
how great Puerto Rico is and everything. Kind of makes me wonder why
so many of them left it in the first place. They have so much pride in
Puerto Rico and they speak of it as if it is a seperate country, so I
say let them have their independence.

Now a days the United States is corrupt and really doesnâ€™t have any
friends in the international community, plus Puerto Ricans are Spanish
and most of the United States is English, so it would be better if
Puerto Rico went on their own.

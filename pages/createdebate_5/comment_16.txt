Hillary Clinton Considers Becoming a Methodist Preacher ? Clinton’s
pastor Bill Shillady told The Atlantic that Clinton had expressed
interest in preaching when he saw her at a photo shoot for his book
Strong for a Moment Like This for which Clinton has written the
foreword. The book features daily devotionals he sent her during the
2016 campaign. https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/ archive/2017/08/

on Hillary for being a Christian ? LMMFAO come on you demented Leftist

This Pastor's psychotic condition can be observed with his fixation
with Fridays. Friday seems to feature in most of his inappropriate
comparisons between Jesus Christ and an incompetent and spiteful
failed politician. This religious zealot is an anti-Friday bigot and
should be prosecuted for blatant Fridayism. Friday worshippers
throughout the world will be greatly insulted by this outburst of
Friday intolerance.

Well, with Jesus' death you have an otherwise normal man who after
his death had the story and the ramifications of it blow way the heck
up and out of proportion so as to advance a cause - which in that case
was the creation and perpetuation and growth of the Christianity
religion itself. And with Clinton's loss you have a not-spectacular
woman drummed up by some to be much more. In that type of comparison
there is a similarity.

	You are ranting Boston Boy ! Oh No Leftist Hillary is a Christian
	inspired by her pastor ! You Leftist now going to be hating on Hillary
	for being a Christian ? LMMFAO come on you demented Leftist do your
	best to defend all that !!!!! Are you defending a Christian Hillary or
	not ?

		I'm ranting? It was three short sentences. In fact it was no longer
		than your reply saying I was ranting. And it was a clever response.
		But that's lost on a guy whose idea of clever is name calling (Boston
		Boy; demented leftist), all caps and short speak (LMMFAO), and
		excessive punctuation (!!!!!) And then your twist to make it about a
		Christian Hillary is just your ploy to morph the topic into your
		religion wheelhouse, which isn't necessary to address the topic.

			But Hillary is Christian and the new found information is hard for
			you to process i know. I have twisted nothing but what i have done is
			put you in a conflicted state of processing information !

		I would like to "defend" the First Amendment from your alt-right
		"rantings" and say her Pastor has the right to think and say what the
		Pastor feels .... just like YOU. The Pastors rantings are harmless ...
		completely different from yours.

	Here is the letter in full, via CNN: Sunday is Coming November 9,
	2016 It is Friday, but Sunday is coming. This is not the devotional I
	had hoped to write. This is not the devotional you wish to receive
	this day. While Good Friday may be the starkest representation of a
	Friday that we have, life is filled with a lot of Fridays. For the
	disciples and Christ's followers in the first century, Good Friday
	represented the day that everything fell apart. All was lost. The
	momentum and hope of a man claiming to be the Son of God, the Messiah
	who was supposed to change everything, had been executed. Even though
	Jesus told his followers three days later the temple would be
	restored, they had no idea of what that Sunday would be. They
	betrayed, denied, mourned, fled and hid. They did just about
	everything BUT feel good about Friday and their circumstances. or us,
	Friday is the phone call from the doctor that the cancer is back. It's
	the news that you have lost your job. It's the betrayal of a friend,
	the loss of someone dear. Friday is the day that it all falls apart
	and all hope is lost. We all have Fridays. But, as the saying goes,
	"Sunday's coming!" Today, you are experiencing a Friday. Your Friday
	is what happened in the last few weeks and last night in the tragic
	loss. But Sunday is coming! Jesus completed the excruciating task of
	giving up his life as a sacrifice for the sins of the world. It was
	his faith and belief in his heavenly Father, that gave him the grace
	and peace to submit to Friday. While death had seemingly won, Jesus
	knew better. When he said, "It is finished," it wasn't meant to be a
	statement of concession. It was a declaration that a new day was on
	the way. Friday is finished. Sunday is coming. Death will be
	shattered. Hope will be restored. But first, we must live through the
	darkness and seeming hopelessness of Friday. You know one of my
	favorite sayings is "God doesn't close one door without opening
	another, but it can be hell in the hallway." My sister Hillary. You,
	our nation, our world is experiencing a black Friday. Our hope is that
	Sunday is coming. But it might well be hell for a while. (CNN) So
	Hillary's pastor thought the Power of God was going to her to the win
	but you Leftist oppose Christianity so where do you stand now on
	religion ?

		That would demonstrate that her pastor was an idiot. But then again,
		he's a pastor. He believes in invisible omnipotent beings pulling the
		strings in the background. Just like you. So really this isn't even
		about Hillary or her pastor. It's about YOU, wanting to believe in
		religious stuff, but then pissed off when someone else believes in
		religious stuff. Half the time their side thinks they're right, half
		the time you do, and whenever one side or the other loses then you
		blame either the devil or the depravity of mankind. It's nonsense no
		matter which side you're coming from. Which all feeds in to the
		relevance of my initial post. It's all drummed up into more than it
		actually was or is.

			https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/ archive/2017/08/ hillary-
			clinton-devotionals/535941/ Hillary Wants to Preach Religion is
			playing a big role in Clinton’s post-election tour. What does she have
			to gain from sharing her faith now? Hillary Clinton wants to preach.
			That’s what she told Bill Shillady, her longtime pastor, at a recent
			photo shoot for his new book about the daily devotionals he sent her
			during the 2016 campaign. Scattered bits of reporting suggest that
			ministry has always been a secret dream of the two-time presidential
			candidate: Last fall, the former Newsweek editor Kenneth Woodward
			revealed that Clinton told him in 1994 that she thought “all the time”
			about becoming an ordained Methodist minister. She asked him not to
			write about it, though: “It will make me seem much too pious.” The
			incident perfectly captures Clinton’s long campaign to modulate—and
			sometimes obscure—expressions of her faith. Boston Boy you going to
			deny what the Atlantic says ?

Someone explain to me how the 10 commandments, "my statutes shall
stand forever", "Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and forever",
"God never changes", God's intolerance of sin and open rebellion, and
"for a man to lie with a man as if a woman is an abomination to God"
comes off as Liberal.

Hello poochy boy: Well, there's that.. And, then there's Trump's

Isn't this just a clear example of what the right thinks of the First
Amendment? THEY can DO or SAY what THEY feel, but anyone not on their
side doesn't HAVE that right, and they'll probably use the Second
Amendment to prove it! I believe Jesus was likely a good MAN, and from
what I can deduce from his alleged beliefs, he would likely be a
liberal and condemn the hate on the right.

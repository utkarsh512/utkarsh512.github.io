SUPER STUPID you like links so link us the Private Highways you claim that exist !!!!!!!!!!!!##$$##@@https://utkarsh512.github.io/pages/createdebate_5/comment_1.txt@#@#@I will agree with some of this. Yes sometimes a 16-17 year old, in the event of emergency circumstance such as going to the bathroom or taking care of a physical issue, should be able to go. In most instance teachers will allow them but if the teacher does not and that bathroom emergency is dire (Not just washing hands because they are dirty) then the student should be able to get up and go. Sometimes being an adult is making a decision that you'll have repercussions for but they are the best decision for you. If you find you need to wash your hands often during a class, make it a habit to bring baby wipes or something. You can apply for a learners permit at 15 in most states if not all which is a HUGE adult responsibility. You can get a job at 16 in most states, also a huge responsibility. Do you think as you get older you get more privileges? Soon enough you'll have the responsibility of paying for college, paying rent, paying mortgage, and sacrificing wants vs. needs.##$$##@@https://utkarsh512.github.io/pages/createdebate_5/comment_2.txt@#@#@I didn't say it had to be specifically had to be his own lawyer.

Use your brain and understand there is not enough money from Rich people to even come close to paying for all this free stuff. YOU WILL BE PAYING MUCH MORE THAN YOU EVER GET OUT OF GOVERNMENT! The Democrat Party helps one group of people in this nation, and it's the able bodied dead beats who refuse to work. The GOP has no problem helping those who can't help themselves. Why did College tuition's SKYROCKET when the Government got involved with low cost student loans? LOOK AT ALL THE STUDENTS NOW IN DEBT UP TO THEIR EARS! This is always the result of Government intervention into the private market.##$$##@@https://utkarsh512.github.io/pages/createdebate_5/comment_9.txt@#@#@ROFLOL, do you fools ever get tired of hating Trump? You bring back memories of the days when there were witch hunts. You are showing everyone what arrogant control fanatics you are. You can not stand that you no longer are getting your way. You can not stand no longer having the bully pulpit to force your politcal correctness on all Americans. You can't stand that Americans elected Trump over your extremist Democrat Party. You can't stand that Trump is proving to everyone that Conservative politics WORKS! Our economy is FINALLY growing, the stock market exploding, ISIS being defeated, unemployment record lows, tax cuts for the working man for a change, people no longer forced to pay tax penalties if they do not buy health insurance, so many worthless regulations stopped, etc. AND YOU CAN NOT STAND WATCHING IT HAPPEN.

But i believe those institutions come part in parcel with rebuilding efforts for the entire region. Its really a matter of whether allocating that FEMA funding is considered passing a "law" respecting an establishment of religion. It is in the budget which is passed by congress so i would say yes. However i believe its perfectly all right for the reason i stated before and only if theyre rebuilding all religious institutions in the area. They cant just rebuild the catholic churches and not rebuild a mosque for instance. My personal opinion is that is ridiculously expensive and we shouldnt fund it. But constitutional? Probably. Its not really a direct endorsement of religion which was really the intent of the 1st amendment protections. The second one is perfectly fine. Religious institutions are not allowed to publicly preach on behalf of candidates and directly endorse them. However after someone is already in office they still represent those constituents in the churches. So of course theyre able to make policy requests to their representatives.##$$##@@https://utkarsh512.github.io/pages/createdebate_5/comment_14.txt@#@#@LMMFAO !

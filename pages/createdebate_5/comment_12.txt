You once said you were just like Trump, and that was why you didn't
like him.

	You once said you were just like Trump, and that was why you didn't
	like him. Hello bront: I'm like Trump in that I'd break norms and
	crack heads to get shit done.. That doesn't require me to be a racist
	asshole, though.. excon

		Which races does Donald Trump consider to be inferior ?

			Which races does Donald Trump consider as inferior ? Hello again,
			Big: You tell me.. Here's what he said the day he came down the
			escalator and announced his candidacy: "When Mexico sends its people,
			they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not
			sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and
			they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs.
			They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good
			people." He may not THINK they're "inferior", but he surly HATES 'em.

				For an elementary illustration of tactics, take parts of your face as
				the point of reference; your eyes, your ears, and your nose. First the
				eyes; if you have organized a vast, mass-based people’s organization,
				you can parade it visibly before the enemy and openly show your power.
				Second the ears; if your organization is small in numbers, then do
				what Gideon did: conceal the members in the dark but raise a din and
				clamor that will make the listener believe that your organization
				numbers many more than it does. Third, the nose; if your organization
				is too tiny even for noise, stink up the place. Saul Alinsky "Rules
				for Radicals" p. 126 ----- In 1969, Hillary Rodham wrote a 92-page
				senior thesis for Wellesley College about community organizer Saul
				Alinsky entitled "There Is Only the Fight . . . : An Analysis of the
				Alinsky Model." The thesis is now available.
				https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HillaryRodham senior thesis Leftist
				tactics can work to a point, but the problem is, once you are
				revealed, from that point on, no one believes a damn word leftist
				politicians and media say. Nobody's buying the left's bullshit.
				Frustrating isn't it?

				He may not THINK they're "inferior", but he surly HATES 'em. Do you
				mean to say he hates Mexican criminals? That's not the same as being
				racist. He was clearly not referring to all Mexicans in that quote.
				Also if you read the whole transcript, this was in referrence to
				illegal immigrants, not all Mexican immigrants. Trump has said on
				numerous occasions that he welcomes legal immigrants of all races.

				"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They
				aren't. Is MS13 and a caravan that is loaded with sickness and willing
				to break our laws their best? If it is, I don't want any of them.
				They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending
				people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems
				with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're
				rapists. And some, I assume, are good people." I couldn't have said it
				better myself. He may not THINK they're "inferior", but he surly HATES
				'em. He may not THINK they're "inferior", but he surly HATES 'em. Or
				he loves America enough to block Communist schemes orchestrated
				through the anti-American Marxist group Pueblo Sin Fronteras and no
				amount of leftist ad hominems will stop him or us.

				LIAR if like Mexico so much why don't you just pack up and move
				??????? Go enjoy a country that is over run with drug cartels and see
				how well you like it ! Any information given to you about what the
				MEDIA tells you and that information contradicts what you believe it
				causes you real problems !

Hi ex., it would be important for you to recognize that you have a
unhealthy obsession with Outlaw, President Trump and those who your
diseased mind perceives as racists. Also, by claiming to have some of
President Trump's determination demonstrates that you are seriously
delusional. Not much hope for you old bean .

He's vile like Trump. You must have missed the Democrat Party. You
should watch it some time. It's a movie about people getting rich off
of politics while pretending they care and flopping on issues like a
fish on the beach... He can't read like Trump. Cool. Becoming a
billionaire with the inability to even read is very impressive. He
doesn't understand the Constitution like Trump. You've ignored my
plenary power points for a couple of weeks now. He makes up shit like
Trump. The Democrat Party is a full blown Alinskyism propaganda scheme
machine. Trump could lie every five minutes and never catch them. He
lies like Trump. On his side, back, face to the bed? He's racist like
Trump. Interesting. He has the highest polling with blacks of any
modern Republican President. Secondly, if I get through a day without
Democrats attacking whites, Jews and "Uncle Toms", and/or
orchestrating a fake racial attack, it'll be a first...

Let's drop the RACISM bullshit and look into an AP story about your
GOD OBAMA that CNN forgot to tell you about. You must know that you
know NOTHING and that IS evident each and every day !!!!!!!!!!
https://www.apnews.com/ ffc60235c26c470c9047e0da6ff19f95 The Obama
administration used the 1917 Espionage Act with unprecedented vigor,
prosecuting more people under that law for leaking sensitive
information to the public than all previous administrations combined.
Obama’s Justice Department dug into confidential communications
between news organizations and their sources as part of that effort.
In 2013 the Obama administration obtained the records of 20 Associated
Press office phone lines and reporters’ home and cell phones, seizing
them without notice, as part of an investigation into the disclosure
of information about a foiled al-Qaida terrorist plot. AP was not the
target of the investigation. But it called the seizure a “massive and
unprecedented intrusion” into its news-gathering activities, betraying
information about its operations “that the government has no
conceivable right to know.” TROLL you cannot handle the TRUTH because
you are a WEAK LEFTIST !!!!!!!!!!!!

	you cannot handle the TRUTH because you are a WEAK LEFTIST But I was
	under the impression that we were the victors in WW2, and you were the
	guys who lost. We literally ran your lot out of Europe mate. That's
	the only reason you're hiding in the United States in the first place.
	Truth stings boy.

		Have you checked with this website ???????
		http://www.stopwar.org.uk/index.php/ usa-war-on-terror/ 1573-how-many-
		civilians-have-been-kille d-in-11-years-of-the-war-on-terror It's
		almost never discussed in the political mainstream. But thousands of
		foreign troops have now been stationed in Britain for more than 70
		years. There's been nothing like it since the Norman invasion. With
		the 15-month Dutch occupation of London in 1688-9 a distant
		competitor, there has been no precedent since 1066 for the presence of
		American forces in a string of military bases for the better part of a
		century. They arrived in 1942 to fight Nazi Germany. But they didn't
		head home in 1945; instead, they stayed on for the 40-odd years of the
		cold war, supposedly to repel invasion from the Soviet Union. Nor did
		they leave when the cold war ended and the Soviet Union collapsed, but
		were invited to remain as the pivot of the anti-Soviet Nato alliance
		The website shows you lie but you cannot use Goggle because that is a
		company that makes to much money!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LMMFAO !!!!!!!!!

		The only right winger in WW2 was Churchill.. Germany and Italy were
		Socialists, Russia was Communist, and America was run by the
		Democrats. Leftists can't keep their violent hands off of others, even

			The only right winger in WW2 was Churchill. “I am an English Liberal.
			I hate the Tory Party, their men, their words and their methods.”
			(Winston Churchill, 1903). Germany and Italy were Socialists Bronto,
			stop using puppet accounts to repeat your Nazi propaganda you
			irritating little shitbag. Neither the Nazis nor the brownshirts had
			anything to do with socialism. The historical record confirms
			unequivocally that they were fascists who were on the far right.
			Indeed, the Nazis murdered millions of socialists. Shut your lying
			fucking mouth. Far-right politics are politics further on the right of
			the left-right spectrum than the standard political right,
			particularly in terms of extreme nationalism,[1][2] nativist
			ideologies, and authoritarian tendencies.[3] The term is often used to
			describe Nazism,[4] neo-Nazism, fascism, neo-fascism and other
			ideologies or organizations that feature ultranationalist, chauvinist,
			xenophobic, racist, anti-communist or reactionary views.[5] These can
			lead to oppression and violence against groups of people based on
			their supposed inferiority, or their perceived threat to the native
			ethnic group,[6][7] nation, state[8] or ultraconservative traditional
			social institutions.[9] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right

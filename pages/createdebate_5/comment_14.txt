The 1st one is a really tough question. technically it is using us
tax dollars to build a religious institution. But i believe those
institutions come part in parcel with rebuilding efforts for the
entire region. Its really a matter of whether allocating that FEMA
funding is considered passing a "law" respecting an establishment of
religion. It is in the budget which is passed by congress so i would
say yes. However i believe its perfectly all right for the reason i
stated before and only if theyre rebuilding all religious institutions
in the area. They cant just rebuild the catholic churches and not
rebuild a mosque for instance. My personal opinion is that is
ridiculously expensive and we shouldnt fund it. But constitutional?
Probably. Its not really a direct endorsement of religion which was
really the intent of the 1st amendment protections. The second one is
perfectly fine. Religious institutions are not allowed to publicly
preach on behalf of candidates and directly endorse them. However
after someone is already in office they still represent those
constituents in the churches. So of course theyre able to make policy
requests to their representatives.

It's insane how the Left has taken a "LETTER" written by Jefferson,
and making everyone believe that this "LETTER" has anything to do with
the Constitution! Who cares what any man wrote in any letter. What
matters is the final wording in the Constitution! There are no words
mentioning separation of church and state in the Constitution. I will
only address what the Constitution actually says... "Congress shall
make no law respecting an establishment. of religion, or prohibiting
the free exercise thereof." A community's freedom to display or not
display a nativity scene is NOT ESTABLISHING RELIGION, but is actually
exercising their Constitutional freedoms! The people who live in every
community should always have the freedom to vote on issues such as
displaying a simple nativity scene celebrating our Nation's Christian
heritage.

	It's insane No, YOU are insane. You are a militantly religious nutbag
	who thinks women should be physically forced to carry unwanted
	pregnancies for no other reason than your own ultra right wing
	Christian beliefs about sin. If you were just quietly insane in a
	little corner somewhere then it wouldn't be such a problem, but the
	pernicious thing about your particular type of insanity is that you
	become sexually aroused at the mere thought of infecting someone else
	with your vile and regressive dogmatism. I just feel sorry for your
	children, who did absolutely nothing to deserve such wicked parents.
	If ever there were an open shut argument for abortion then you are it.
	Congratulations.

		Thanks for showing the true intolerance of the Left. You are now
		added to my auto ban list because there can be no intelligent debate
		with such a hateful judgmental person.

		All I heard out of this is.... "I'm passionate about defending
		abortion because I'm a piece of shit" Good going, Joe.

Laws regarding rape aren't intended to prevent rape so much as they
are to punish rapists and protect victims after the fact.

	Has it stopped the crime ? No it has not. So do tell do we need as a
	society rape control ?

		Again, it's mostly not going to stop rapists from raping. It's moreso
		for protecting the victims after the fact. I don't know if you must
		didn't read my original comment or couldn't make sense of it, but here
		it is again.

		Laws against rape certainly reduced amounts of rape. If there were no
		laws against rape, there would be more rape. I think that is somewhat
		obvious.

	Deterrence is the single primary purpose of law and punishment.

		Not an argument. Also not backed by any evidence.

Did the death penalty stop people committing serious crimes ....?
Laws are there to protect the public however I agree with the above
that this is often the case after the fact to give justice to the
victim and penalty to the perpetrator

	Do tell what stops people from committing serious crimes ? Has any
	law stopped that ?

They are not expected to "stop" it, just to let idiots know that it
is against the law, and that they will be punished. Then again, we do
have laws and regulations that really DO save lives, like speed
limits, safety belts, and having to have a license to drive a car. We
have to have a license and be tested to drive a car, fly a plane, be a
health care practitioner, a plumber, an electrician. Most things that
are a potential danger to people, but, we don't have to be licensed
and pass a test to "carry". Strange.

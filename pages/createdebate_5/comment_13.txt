The American government needs more than a slap to the face, it needs
to punch to the face and kick in the groin. Basically, it needs a
Chuck Norris roundhouse kick.

	And that's just for starters. No more should we let them bully us
	around and take our rights. Fat taxes, incandescent light bulb bans,
	recycling, gun control, wars, etc. - they don't have our best interest
	in mind and, even if they did, I'd rather come upon my best interest
	myself not have them hand it to me.

As long as we moderately last for 50 more years, I don't really care
what they do as long as they don't do things any worse.

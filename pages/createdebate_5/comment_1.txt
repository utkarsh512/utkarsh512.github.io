The interstate is paid for by capitalism and has nothing to do with
the means of production. It's built by independent contractors via
capitalism.

	The interstate is paid for by capitalism and has nothing to do with
	the means of production. It's built by independent contractors via
	capitalism. Hello Spuds: Look.. I'm a capitalist.. Capitalism CREATES
	wealth. Socialism doesn't.. Socialism SPENDS wealth, and that's what
	we're talking about here.. So, when we're talking about funding,
	there's only ONE source for funding, and that's the American taxpayer.
	To argue it's NOT socialism because it was paid for by capitalism
	isn't a very good argument.. Look.. Do we agree that Medicare is
	socialism?? We SHOULD, because it IS.. Do we agree that capitalism
	created the money spent for Medicare?? We should, cause as previously
	mentioned, there's no other source. Once you pay your taxes, is it
	your money any longer? No. It's government money. Back to your
	example. Yes, it's built by independent contractors who are PAID with
	tax dollars.. It's OWNED and MAINTAINED by "your tax dollars at work".
	You've seen those signs, haven't you??? And, yes.. There are a few
	PRIVATE highways out there, mostly in the East.. Those are NOT
	socialism.. You PAY to use them. You get the difference, don't you??
	Maybe not. excon

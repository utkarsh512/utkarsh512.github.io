YOU ARE CORRECT! I wish some would stop using that FREE word! What
they should be saying is MORE AFFORDABLE! That's what everyone wants,
not FREE. THAT can be DONE! We just have to get the tax money from the
60 corporations that PAY NONE, and close the loopholes WE, the PEOPLE,
don't HAVE! It would HELP if Trump payed HIS, he already said he's too
smart too, and maybe cut back a bit on his $M golf outings? He's not
taking a salary, he's "taking" America!

	ROAD ISLAND AL says this without any facts - We just have to get the
	tax money from the 60 corporations that PAY NONE DUMMY where is the
	list of the FALSE CLAIM you have made ????????????????????

	I cannot believe that ROAD ISLAND AL is still in distress that
	HILLARY was a piss poor CANDIDATE if she wasn't then AL'S party would
	not have thrown HER under the bus for the LYING NIGGER who was a
	COMMUNITY ORGANIZER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

		The "false claim" I made has been all over the internet, the news
		media (likely not FAUX News, though ;-), I don't see how ANYBODY that
		watches ANYTHING BUT right wing lies, could have missed it. Of course,
		REALLY STUPID people only see what they want to see! I'd give you a
		link but that would be like giving a butcher a rubber knife … he
		wouldn't even TRY to use it! :-) As far as Hillary is concerned, it's
		YOU who keeps bringing her up. I was reading the other day (You should
		try it sometime). A man named H.H. Munro said: "He is one of those
		people who would be enormously improved by death." I couldn't help
		thinking of YOU …. I hate white supremacists, racists, bigots,
		especially when they, unexplainably call themselves "Christian". Being
		the LOWEST form of human being (and I use the term loosely …. VERY
		loosely :-), You are FAR below any, as YOU called him, "LYING NIGGER"
		that ever lived! You should try to elevate yourself to the level of
		those black and brown and yellow and red people who try to improve
		themselves every day! I don't think I've ever seen a ladder that is
		long enough though. You have a nice day in hell. Please, stay out of
		Rhode Island … we're trying to clean the place up! Providence is a
		"sanctuary city", we may be having visitors. :-)

	Stop being such a low end puppet to these idiot Democrats who have
	been playing the same tax the Rich toon for many many decades! Use
	your brain and understand there is not enough money from Rich people
	to even come close to paying for all this free stuff. YOU WILL BE
	PAYING MUCH MORE THAN YOU EVER GET OUT OF GOVERNMENT! The Democrat
	Party helps one group of people in this nation, and it's the able
	bodied dead beats who refuse to work. The GOP has no problem helping
	those who can't help themselves. Why did College tuition's SKYROCKET
	when the Government got involved with low cost student loans? LOOK AT
	ALL THE STUDENTS NOW IN DEBT UP TO THEIR EARS! This is always the
	result of Government intervention into the private market.

		What happened to Trumps YUGE employment level … EVERYONE is working,
		even blacks and Hispanic employment level are "the best in history!"
		The "able-bodied deadbeats" are WORKING! I'm SURE Herr Gropenfuhrer
		would say it's because HE "created" so many jobs! THAT infers that
		there weren't jobs FOR them before. ;-) College tuitions "skyrocketed"
		because the capitalists running and supporting them want to "get rich
		quicker" like all the rest of the capitalists! Yep, they're too greedy
		to accept "low cost students" for the good of the country (or, its
		people that can't afford an education, otherwise). HOW DARE THEY!
		We'll just charge those that CAN pay, MORE! (And rip off "our"
		government more for those they send.) Why should we give those "able-
		bodied deadbeats an education!" Because you like to have able-bodied
		deadbeats …. to beat?? The "private market" OWNES our government,
		mostly (at least the RIGHT side of it), at this time. That's why the
		deficit is going SO high SO fast.

			WOW, fake news has done a bang up job on
			you.................................... ...... Take a look at your
			beloved Socialist Bernie Sander's tax returns, and see the Rich
			Democrat hypocrites grabbing every tax loop hole and giving pennies to
			help the poor. When the Democrats had control of Congress and White
			house after Obama's first election, how come they were able to pass
			Obamacare without one GOP vote, but never raised taxes on Rich folks
			such as themselves? For decades we have heard these phony hypocrites
			preach TAX THE RICH, TAX THE RICH, TAX THE RICH, and when they had the
			chance they did NOTHING! IF YOU VOTE FOR THESE CORRUPT FOOLS, YOU
			DESERVE EVERYTHING YOU GET.

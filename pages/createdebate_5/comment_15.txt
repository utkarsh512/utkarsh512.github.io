You might want to get lefties to stop quoting him first Excon. And in
their case, they aren't quoting him to make a point, but to glorify
killing Jews. The beam is still in your eye.

It is if the person debating you says "Hitler was right wing" and you
have Nazi quotes where actual Nazis, including Hitler, say they were
left wing.

Is citing a NAZI ever a good debating technique? Probably not. He
said a lot of leftist things, and most leftist things are unhinged
nonsense.

If you're citing about the Nazi-like actions or statements of a
guy/girl trying to spread Nazi-like hate or agenda, YES! Problem is,
MOST of "them" have never actually SEEN, or think what they see is
"fake news" … stupidly … and have imaginary greatness in their small
minds! Nazi-ism, (white nationalism) is NOTHING GREAT, other than a
"great disaster"! If the conservative Trump Party (as opposed to the
Republican Party), win on Tuesday, I believe it will be the start of a
horrendous "lesson" for them.

If you want to illustrate what a Nazi said, the. You have to quote
them. If they are saying the same things we are hearing today, then
perhaps you don’t know when you are quoting a Nazi.

If someone says they hate the Jews and believe the supremacy of an
ethnostate, you will think that’s a new idea unless someone cites a
Nazi for you. Ignorance is not preferable.

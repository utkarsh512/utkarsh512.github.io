Comments:

If Democrats want all Americans to vomit, they should continue with
Obstruction. This is the Party that chose Hillary to represent them!
Obstruction? LOL, there is not a politician alive who has not at one
time obstructed information to prevent any possible political damage.
Obstruction should be part of the definition of a Politician.

While Democrats pivot to obstruction I'm still waiting to see
collusion Hello bront: At this point, it's NOT a matter of whether
there WAS collusion.. It's a matter of whether the collusion that WAS
there, rises to a level where it can be proven beyond a reasonable
doubt.. It doesn't appear that it can be.. But, there's PLENTY of BAD
behavior that, INDEED, rises to the level of a High Crime and
Misdemeanor.. Here's the good news for you.. The pussy Democrats say
let's NOT impeach him.. Let's just defeat him. I say THROW HIS ORANGE
ASS OUT.. excon

	But, there's PLENTY of BAD behavior that, INDEED, rises to the level
	of a High Crime and Misdemeanor.. Cool. Like Fusion GPS who was
	working for Hillary sending a Russian lawyer to Trump tower to try and
	frame him? Or that the Russia collusion story was written by Fusion
	GPS's Glenn Simpson in 2007? https://www.wsj.com/articles/
	SB117674837248471543 Here's the good news for you.. The pussy
	Democrats say let's NOT impeach him.. Let's just defeat him. I say
	THROW HIS ORANGE ASS OUT.. Good luck. Impeachment conviction has a 0
	percent chance. After the psychopathy of the left in the last 2 years,
	good luck defeating him. He won when his poll popularity was in the
	tank and Russia collusion was on the table. Black approval has more
	than doubled. But you have those 2 Islamists connected to Hamas and
	the blabbering jackass calling for impeachment still. Hop on that
	wagon.

		good luck defeating him Hello bront: As I've said, he IS cunning..
		Look.. There's NO QUESTION that he's going to go after his enemies..
		What do they say?? If you wanna knock the king off, you better NOT
		miss. The Dems MISSED... Look.. Barr TOLD them WHO he was, and they
		confirmed him anyway.. It's really a matter of how far the country
		will let him go.. I say we stop short of crucifixion. excon

				and somewhat ill-defined[1] grouping of white supremacists/white
				nationalists, neo-Nazis, neo-fascists, neo-Confederates, Holocaust
				deniers, and other far-right[2][3][4] fringe hate groups.[5][6] Alt-
				right beliefs have been described as isolationist, protectionist,
				antisemitic and white supremacist,[7][8][9] frequently overlapping
				with neo-Nazism,[10][11][12][13] identitarianism,[14] nativism and
				Islamophobia,[15][16][17][18][19] antifeminism, misogyny and
				homophobia,[10][20][21][22][13] right-wing populism[23][24] and the
				neoreactionary movement.[7][25] The concept has further been
				associated with several groups such as American nationalists,
				paleoconservatives, anarcho-capitalists, national-anarchists,[26]
				paleolibertarians, Christian fundamentalists, neo-monarchists, men's
				rights advocates and the 2016 presidential campaign of Donald
				Trump.[15][24][25][27][28][14] According to a Southern Poverty Law
				Center report published in February 2018, over 100 people have been
				killed and injured in 13 attacks by alt-right influenced perpetrators
				since 2014. Political scientists and leaders have argued it should be
				classified as a terrorist or extremist movement.

	Not impeaching him helps their odds of defeating him. Impeaching him
	assures they lose on a number of fronts. Itâ€™s not that collusion
	and/or obstruction cannot be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, itâ€™s
	that thereâ€™s not even sufficient reasonable suspicion for a special
	prosecutor to recommend charges. There is plenty of bad behavior there
	for sure, but his supporters are already aware of that kind of bad
	behavior and they donâ€™t care. End result? His supporters still support
	him and his detractors still oppose him. Everyone else is sick of the
	2 year side show that promised 100 and delivered 0.

			I have not, and will not change my mind.. I refuse to believe that

			contradicted themselves about 500 times. Nevermind Strzok and Paige.

			1)Cool. You support police state tactics. 2)Interesting. A tyrant who
			takes no salary, and does nothing tyrannical. Or do you have some

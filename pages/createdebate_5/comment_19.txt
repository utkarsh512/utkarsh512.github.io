No, well not Trump at any rate, who is known as 'Honest Don' among
the business fraternity. He is a straight businessman and an astute
politician and when he heard about Hillary being struck down with
pneumonia he congratulated the leader and the people of pneumonia for
their assistance. He said, I get on great with the Pneumonians, and I
get on well with it's leader General Whatisname, who is a close
personal friend of mine,and who has said many nice things about me,
and I'm glad to get the help of Pneumonia to defeat crooked Hillary.
He went on;- I'd hoped to get help from Putin and the people of Russia
but they're not taking my calls at the moment, so thank heavens for
the people of Pneumonia. Now there's what I call a shrewd, sagacious
President in waiting.

	He's actually known for some incredibly dishonest business dealings,
	from defrauding the elderly, to refusing to pay for work that has
	already been done (that he doesn't go on to have re-done), to in-
	effect defrauding investors for failed real estate ventures, to his
	business using slave labor in the Middle East, etc.

		If you had read my reply properly you would have noticed the
		sarcastic tone of it's content. But, as usual you're straining at the
		leash to get the old poison pen into action. It is however, gratifying
		to note that you find it necessary to follow my posts around like a
		''lap dog'' to see what you may learn. Sit, go down, roll over, come,
		heel, fetch, stay. Like all good little doggies trained for obedience
		you too must learn those basic words of command. Now, fetch and stay.

		Well, it just goes to let's ye shows ye. Can you imagine how things
		would be if ever we hear him referred to as;- Ex President Donald
		Trump? ''GASP'' The really frightening thought is, whoever wins is
		going to have the power to blow up the world. Man,man oh man.

			Honestly, that's the main reason I am voting for Hillary Clinton over
			him. He has consistently demonstrated a refusal to rule out first-
			strike nuclear attacks, he is on the record saying he would attack
			Iran over some sailors taunting one of our boats, his actions with
			NATO would fundamentally shift the diplomatic landscape of Europe most
			likely causing a heightening of tensions regarding Russia (since they
			would be able to act in Europe far less hindered), he wants more
			countries to obtain nuclear weaponry, etc. Not a fan of Hillary
			Clinton, but she has demonstrated a preference for either diplomacy,
			or light military action quite literally to a fault. I'll take that
			over someone who is likely to start a world war because he misread
			their "body language".

		Hillary is not dishonest is she ? Hillary has plenty of connections
		to the Middle East. Did you miss that ?
		[Posted by DBCooper at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

			Did you know that Isis has openly come out and said they hope
			Americans vote for Donald J Trump? Does that sound right to you? That
			the terrorist group dedicated to trying to destroy us wants us to
			choose him? I hope and I repeat I hope you wouldn't do what terrorists
			want you to do. You know they say a word to the wise is sufficient,
			and here I've gone and written a paragraph.

			She may not be as honest as you think. Remember the email crisis? Or
			how about the person she could've saved, but didn't? She is very
			dishonest. Trump on the other hand is very honest, about the wrong
			things. And do not tell me to prove these things because just watch
			the news.
			[Posted by Debatest at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

				If you "just watch the news" then you'd see that Trump isn't honest.
				If you'd like I can go ahead and actually show you the research to
				demonstrate this, if you are open to evidence.

	Trump is a businessman not a politician. And not saying he was a good
	one either.

Hillary should be in jail because she is a proven perjurer in the
Benghazi hearings. She had the entire administration and department of
Justice and the FBI on her side. She and those running this nation
have proven to be above the law, and TOTAL IDIOTS will still vote for
her. These selfish charity cases and socialist ideologs are why our
government is so corrupt. YOU ENABLE IT! Have you noticed that no one
from all the scandals, the IRS partisan witch hunts, Fast and furious,
Clinton Foundation pay to play, private email server with classified
government documents, Benghazi lies, people pleading the fifth all
over the place and NO ONE ever gets punished!!!!!!! Trump has not been
found guilty of anything worth jail time. People who spew this
Leftwing rhetoric are complete morons! I wanted Cruz as well, but as
always, the elctorate fears any Conservative or Christian. They are
bigots who have been conditioned to fear the very thing our nation
DESPARATELY NEEDS. We are going bankrupt and only true Conservatives
like Cruz would do what has to be done to cut that debt. Most other
politicans promise everything to get elected. This is why the
establishment hated Cruz. This is another reason why he had no chance.
We are left with a criminal and a guy who can't debate. Trump is as
always the lessor of two evils. He does seem to have a back bone to
actually lead our nation and stop the insanity of political
correctness. He might actually fire people if they refuse to cut waste
and frud in our Government. Maybe he cn finlly run our nation as it
should be run when it comes to our debt. Hillary is all that is wrong
with Government. Anyone who would vote for her is lacking any common
sense knowledge to what is all wrong with our nation.

	Hillary should be in jail because she is a proven perjurer in the
	Benghazi hearings. Trump should be in jail since he is a proven con
	artist and a self admitted tax evader. She had the entire
	administration and department of Justice and the FBI on her side. If
	you think the FBI report was them being on her side you must think I
	am on your side. She and those running this nation have proven to be
	above the law, and TOTAL IDIOTS will still vote for her. It doesn't
	really help that her opponent holds himself above the law too. Trump
	has not been found guilty of anything worth jail time. False. Untrue.
	Deception. Lies. People who spew this Leftwing rhetoric are complete
	morons! Yeah, why don't you try the concept of not using Republican
	rhetoric like a moron right before accusing others of using leftwing
	rhetoric.
	[Posted by Cartman at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	You would have so much more legitimacy if you didn't pardon the
	criminality of Trump and everything wrong he has done.
	[Posted by IAmSparticus at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	I wanted Cruz as well, he was extremely trust worthy and was a leader
	in multiple protests and revolts. He was the person the people chose
	to lead them. But the government thinks not. Sadly. Cruz wanted the
	best for the country, the actual best. Not banning some immigrants,
	not raising minimum wage (increasing taxes and hurting small
	companies). He wanted only good. R.I.P the United States Of America.
	[Posted by Debatest at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

		The people clearly didn't choose Cruz to lead him, otherwise he would
		have received the nomination. The man was incredibly dangerous and led
		the government shutdown which was the leading factor for our debt
		rating decrease. The things he wanted would have been far from
		positive for this country, as evidenced by his actual effects on our
		nation.
		[Posted by IAmSparticus at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

Yes. They should bring it to speaker of the house. No joke. Anyone
got a sniper? People are dumb, which is why we have Trimp v Clinton to
begin with. People I don't think are smart enough to rule themselves
or elect good leaders to rule for them. Be insulted if you must. The
electoral college is one thing but our government is going the way of
Rome I believe. Whats wrong with the decision is obvious. Yes.
[Posted by ghostheadX at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	The electoral college is one thing Meaning the disproportionality of
	representation for rural states over more densely populated states, or
	??
	[Posted by JustIgnoreMe at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

		Right so the way the electoral college works is bad enough (like you
		said). To me, if anything, more population should have more delegates.
		But worse, I think the majority of the delegates should have refused
		to cast their votes for Clinton or Trump. Cruz v. Sanders would have
		been a much more optimistic race.
		[Posted by ghostheadX at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

			If the entire electoral college dismissed the votes of the
			electorate, they would be not only violating their purpose, but they
			would lead to the immediate deconstruction of the electoral college as
			a system.

Both have crimes against the constitution Namely what exactly?
[Posted by JustIgnoreMe at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	Both have had various scandals. Clinton deleted classified info and
	pardoned assassins, etc. Trump has been sued numerous times for shit.
	You can google this easily and get the results. That said, I don't
	know that he's right to say its a "crime against the constitution." I
	think he means "Have had various scandals."
	[Posted by ghostheadX at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

		pardoned assassins I must have missed that one - I didn't think
		Hillary was ever a President or Governor with the power to pardon
		before. Can you elaborate? I don't know that he's right to say its a
		"crime against the constitution." I think you're right that they
		misspoke there.
		[Posted by JustIgnoreMe at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

			She didn't do it directly but when Bill was president in the 1990s,
			she had him pardon terrorists who had bombed buildings in the 1970s.
			[Posted by ghostheadX at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

				They were already rehabilitated and had been in prison for 2 decades,
				and only caused property damage. Calling them assassins is dishonest.
				[Posted by IAmSparticus at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

					So is attributing it to Hillary, but hey... Presumably they're
					talking weather underground peeps, or? Edit: nevermind, I found it (I
					think) - Linda Evans and Susan Rosenberg
					[Posted by JustIgnoreMe at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

						Nah, a Puerto Rican paramilitary organization called FALN (Fuerzas
						Armadas de Liberación Nacional Puertorriqueña) that set off a bunch of
						bombs in Chicago and New York, but only caused property damage much
						like Weather Underground (this is somewhat disputed, however, with
						Congress at the time holding them responsible for 6 deaths which have
						tenuous links). Hillary Clinton had initially supported it, but later
						withdrew her support (kinda par for the course with her I suppose).
						Why this is being blamed on her is entirely beyond me.
						[Posted by IAmSparticus at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

							So, not Hillary, not unconstitutional, and ten Nobel Peace Prize
							winners, the Cardinal of New York, and the Archbishop of Puerto Rico
							all endorsed it. sounds like the typical Clinton "scandal" to me.
							[Posted by JustIgnoreMe at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

								Pretty much, yeah. She does have the Email Scandal, no doubt there,
								but that's basically it. The "scandal" over her Foundation was
								essentially a load of horseshit, the scandal over her husband's
								affairs isn't hers, the scandal over Benghazi led to a Republican
								panel not coming up with any legitimate charges or finding of fault,
								etc. People are so caught up with this idea that Hillary is "Scandal
								ridden" that they are making up scandals to prove it.
								[Posted by IAmSparticus at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

									If someone investigated me for the last 30 years (or most anyone
									else), they surely would have found a lot more to complain about. They
									think if they just say Clinton next to scandal enough that people will
									automatically lose trust, but that would never wor... oh, wait
									[Posted by JustIgnoreMe at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

										That's literally Breitbart's business model. That and throwing in
										"Big Gay Hate Machine" every now and then.
										[Posted by IAmSparticus at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

					Ok maybe I wouldn't call them assassins but their intent was to kill
					and they would otherwise stayed in jail as deserved.
					[Posted by ghostheadX at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

						Actually none of the 16 pardoned were convicted for conspiracy to
						commit murder, only for conspiracy to commit property crimes. Again,
						you shouldn't dishonestly portray the circumstances of this.
						[Posted by IAmSparticus at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

							True but how do we know what their intents were. How does she? If
							they blew up a bomb, just cuz they weren't convicted of killing so
							then isn't it better to assums the worst scenario of intent, which is
							pretty likely right?
							[Posted by ghostheadX at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

								No, because "assume the worst" is the exact opposite of our
								assumption of innocence in the justice system.
								[Posted by IAmSparticus at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

									Ok but my point is if someone sets off a bomb in public what do you
									think their intent is just cuz no one got hurt? Any rational person
									says their intent is to kill. There are much easier ways of property
									damage. Just get a baseball bat.
									[Posted by ghostheadX at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

			she also intimidated Bill's rape victims into staying quiet. she lied
			about Benghazi, and the list goes on.
			[Posted by ghostheadX at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

				she lied about Benghazi How so? and the list goes on Does it though?
				[Posted by JustIgnoreMe at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

					https://m.youtube.com/ watch?v=9IOpbj8ajZs Watch that. The list does
					go on.
					[Posted by ghostheadX at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

						Not off to a great start - "Movie She Banned From Theaters" - she
						didn't ban anything from theaters because it wasn't even going to be
						played in a theater - it was going to be video-on demand on cable - I
						remember because it was a major discussion point during oral arguments
						on the case.
						[Posted by JustIgnoreMe at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

							you didn't denythat she banned it from being released and admitted
							it'd be released otherwise, or at least its implied in your disputing
							statement
							[Posted by ghostheadX at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

								She didn't ban anything. The case is called Citizens United v FEC for
								a reason. The FEC was in charge of enforcing rules on certain
								electioneering communications, and Citizens United - knowing that
								their film would fall under those regulations - preemptively sued the
								FEC.
								[Posted by JustIgnoreMe at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

									And Hillary has no say in the FEC? ghvfughvfughvfughvfughvfughvfu
									[Posted by ghostheadX at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

										A) the FEC didn't sue Citizens United, it was the other way around B)
										That correct - she, as 1 Senator out of 100, didn't have say in the
										FEC - the FEC is a separate agency run by the commissioners, and 4 out
										of 5 commissioners at the time were Bush appointees.
										[Posted by JustIgnoreMe at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

				How does the list go on?
				[Posted by IAmSparticus at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	Hillary supposedly bribed people to keep her from going to jail
	because of "murder" and exposing government files. Trump wishes to
	stop certain ethnicity and races from entering this country, which is
	completely against what this country is for.
	[Posted by Debatest at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

		One of those is fake and one of those happened live on C-SPAN - can
		you tell which is which?
		[Posted by JustIgnoreMe at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

Neither of them have omitted crimes against the Constitution, and
since neither of them have been president yet, there exist no grounds
for impeachment.
[Posted by IAmSparticus at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

	Hillary Bribery and anti 2 amendment. Trump Racist and banning
	certain races from entering this country.
	[Posted by Debatest at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

		First, what bribery are you referring to, and what "2nd amendment"
		crimes has she committed? Second, being racist is against the
		Constitution (or a crime), and his proposed policies regarding
		immigration are not themselves crimes.
		[Posted by IAmSparticus at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

		Do you have a clue how mindlessly stupid you sound when you call
		Trump a racist? Arrogant corrupt elitist liar Hillary called millions
		of good Americans deplorable and irredeemable for voting for Trump.
		SHE'S A CRIMINAL AND A CORRUPT FOOL! I cant debate with idiots who
		spew the same ludicrous lies as she.
		[Posted by FromWithin at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

			Trump is as much of a criminal as she is, and Trump says a lot of
			racist shit.
			[Posted by IAmSparticus at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

				More of a criminal, actually.
				[Posted by Cartman at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

We should impeach the Donald for Harambe. Let Hillary's whip, whip
the D out.
[Posted by instig8or at Not Available - Side: Not Available]

No one is getting impeached. Because basically large factions of the
rich benefit no matter which of them gets into office and ultimately
the rich are pulling the strings on the entire Washington scene.

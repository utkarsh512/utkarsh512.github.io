I'm gay!" The argument is whether or not they should be expelled if and when their sexuality becomes a topic of conversation. Sexual orientation shouldn't really matter at all. I fully concur. However, it shouldn't be about that; one's first identity should simply be an American soldier, not a homosexual American soldier. Well, yeah! THAT is their argument. Here's the thing: a heterosexual can hang pin-ups in their locker, talk about the hot chicks they banged on leave, tell stories about their girlfriends and wives, and not worry about losing their ability to serve their country with honor. Under DADT, homosexuals couldn't do any of tha in regards to the men they liked. When they are firing a bullet into the head of a terrorist, they are a soldier. But they are also comprised of everything that adds up to their whole, including who they find attractive. Also, announcing your homosexuality may induce violence and discrimination. You think they don't know that? In my opinion, one who willingly walks in to a scenario where they might be killed before they even SET FOOT IN ENEMY SOIL is one brave individual. And we need courage in our ranks, especially these days. ALSO, they AREN'T BEING REQUIRED TO ANNOUNCE THEIR SEXUALITY THROUGH A BULLHORN. All that's being asked is that if others discover that they are gay, that it doesn't affect their service record. It may even be in a person's own good to simply keep this information to themselves, because most likely there isn't going to be a lot of gay sex happening in the army anyway.

The Department of the Interior oversees oil and natural gas production on federal lands and waters—providing access to these resources while ensuring their safe and responsible development. Federal oil and gas resources provide an important source of energy for the United States; create jobs in the oil and gas industry; and generate billions of dollars annually in revenues that are shared between federal, state, and tribal governments. Interior reported collecting over $55 billion from fiscal years 2011 through 2016 from royalties and other payments. This makes oil and gas resources one of the federal government’s largest sources of nontax revenue. Pay close attention to FY 2011 through 2016 !!!!!!! 3 - ignoring the Earth our grandchildren will have to live in https://www.energyprofessionals.com/ states/rhode-island/ Natural Gas Natural gas fuels nearly all of Rhode Island’s electric generation and heats half of its households. Rhode Island does not have any natural gas production or reserves. The state’s natural gas is supplied almost entirely by pipeline from Connecticut, which transports natural gas received from New York, but some natural gas also arrives from Massachusetts. Almost two-thirds of the natural gas entering Rhode Island is delivered to Massachusetts. Historically, natural gas has arrived in Rhode Island from producing areas in Canada and from the U.S. Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent regions, but increasing amounts of natural gas are coming from Appalachian Shales, particularly the Marcellus Shale of Pennsylvania. Electric power generators and the residential sector are Rhode Island’s largest natural gas consumers. More than half of the natural gas consumed in the state goes to the electric power sector and almost all in-state electricity generation is fueled with natural gas. As increasing amounts of natural gas are used for electricity generation in Rhode Island, and throughout New England, assurance of natural gas supply has become a critical energy issue for the region.

Rutherford's quest to debunk the highly profitable "genetic astrology" industry has some staunch allies, including the wonderful Sense About Science people (previously), including Steve Jones, Emeritus Professor of Human Genetics at UCL and Prof Mark Thomas. https://boingboing.net/2018/09/25/ you-are-not-a-viking.html Our guide explains why DNA tests are used in population research and why they do not provide accurate information about an individual’s ancestry https://archive.senseaboutscience.org/ pages/genetic-ancestry- testing.html You're a fucking idiot mate.##$$##@@http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Virus_Deaths_in_Democratic_versus_Republican_States@#@#@ROFLOL, TALK ABOUT DOUBLE SPEAK!

Yes sometimes a 16-17 year old, in the event of emergency circumstance such as going to the bathroom or taking care of a physical issue, should be able to go. In most instance teachers will allow them but if the teacher does not and that bathroom emergency is dire (Not just washing hands because they are dirty) then the student should be able to get up and go. Sometimes being an adult is making a decision that you'll have repercussions for but they are the best decision for you. If you find you need to wash your hands often during a class, make it a habit to bring baby wipes or something. You can apply for a learners permit at 15 in most states if not all which is a HUGE adult responsibility. You can get a job at 16 in most states, also a huge responsibility.

But i believe those institutions come part in parcel with rebuilding efforts for the entire region. Its really a matter of whether allocating that FEMA funding is considered passing a "law" respecting an establishment of religion. It is in the budget which is passed by congress so i would say yes. However i believe its perfectly all right for the reason i stated before and only if theyre rebuilding all religious institutions in the area. They cant just rebuild the catholic churches and not rebuild a mosque for instance. My personal opinion is that is ridiculously expensive and we shouldnt fund it. But constitutional? Probably. Its not really a direct endorsement of religion which was really the intent of the 1st amendment protections. The second one is perfectly fine. Religious institutions are not allowed to publicly preach on behalf of candidates and directly endorse them. However after someone is already in office they still represent those constituents in the churches. So of course theyre able to make policy requests to their representatives.##$$##@@http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Separation_of_Church_and_State_Debate@#@#@LMMFAO !

No one will be able to kill someone that comes in killing, or if someone were to come into a school with killing intentions, everyone would be able to take them down and that’s supposed to be the good thing, or better way to go? Ok, now some simple stats. A gun in the home is 2.7 times more likely to kill a family member than an intruder. More guns usually means more victims. The International Crime Victim Survey concluded that there is a link between gun ownership and an increase in both homicide and suicide. Epidemiologists at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine found that, on average, guns don’t protect those who have them from being shot. The study estimated that people with a gun on them were 4.5 times more likely to be shot than those that do not have a gun. Interesting don’t you think? That means ladies and gentleman, that if you have a right for everyone to have a gun at school than you will have more shootings. Point blank! Do you really think that if someone at school gets in a fight, (and this can be very closely related, if you may, to a fight in a bar) that they won’t use whatever they have on them to defend themselves? Answer that, then answer this. When you think of a brawl at school, what comes to mind? Fist fighting? Now give those angry people guns. You get where I’m going with this? Every fight in this country, from schools to bars and anywhere else in the world would not be Settled with the, “fists of furry” any longer. Why would you if you have something on you that Could do more damage anyways? Make it quick and then never have to deal with that person Ever again. Very simple truths when you really think deep down and hard about it. Yes, you could save someone’s life along with maybe a few others if someone were to come into your school shooting at everyone, but, what do you think would happen if everyone, All at once, started shooting their guns? From different angles at that. A lot more people would Be getting hurt in the long run! I have a 270 riffle and love guns and the power they possess. I respect a guns capability to do more than any fist ever could, and that’s just one more to add to my many reasons on why I’m against having guns on campus.##$$##@@http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Should_people_be_allowed_to_carry_weapons_on_a_College_campus@#@#@Barack Obama definetly has more experiens.

GODDAMN BOY you afraid of GOGGLE ???????????? Joe Biden is looking more and more like damaged goods, after Good Morning America couldn't get a straight answer out of the beleaguered former Vice President regarding accusations of rampant nepotism with his son Hunter in both Ukraine and China. Hunter - who is now being sued by an Arkansas woman claiming he fathered her child while also plowing his late brother's widow, and who was recently accused of returning a rental car to an Arizona Hertz location with a used crack pipe and two DC driver's licenses - was given a sweetheart seat on the board of Ukrainian gas giant Burisma, despite having zero experience in Ukraine or the energy industry. During this time, his father Joe Biden used his position as Vice President to pressure Ukraine into firing its top prosecutor who was investigating the company. Questionable dealings were also uncovered in China after journalist and Clinton Cash author Peter Schweizer revealed that in 2013, the father-son duo flew to China on Air Force Two. Two weeks later, Hunter's firm inked a private equity deal for $1 billion with a subsidiary of the Chinese government's Bank of China, which expanded to $1.5 billion, according to an article by Schweizer in the New York Post. https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/jun/20/paternity-suit-lists- bidens-son-49/ https://nypost.com/2019/05/11/the-troubling-reason-why- biden-is-so-soft-on-china/ https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/news/ story/ biden-sidesteps-questions-sons-foreign- business-dealings- promises-63820806 BRAIN DAMAGED it is easy to see that the LEFTIST are DONE with BIDEN and his SON !##$$##@@http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Is_Joe_Biden_a_man_without_a_party@#@#@Are you a fool or a liar?

He calls you a liar because you refuse to admit the simple fact that communism is the opposite of what you say it is. Communism is at the farthest left side of the political spectrum and that means it cannot possibly be tyrannical because left= collectivism/equality. There are no political or economic classes in communism. Right wing systems such as fascism and capitalism are inherently tyrannical because the further right you are the more society is based in social darwinism/hierarchy. What you call "individual freedom" is actually code for individuals having varying levels of personal freedom based on class. When you admit to the basic difference between the left and right you will understand. The left is about social equality by definition and the right is about social darwinism by definition. The Nazis are far right because they split people into groups based on race and based on the same economic and political bullshit that capitalists do. Is that the history of communism? That is the goal and focus and Marxist theory which has been corrupted and used to lure the working class into fascism several times, there has never actually been a communist country.

When love is used at the base of a society it is easily broken when another force appears. If another leader was to use the threat of punishment and inflicting fear on the people, a strong uphold of people will be created as no follower will want to face the consequences of choosing a leader they love. Acting bold and strong in the first campaign is key to having true followers as they will never forget the threat and punishment whereas love and compassion can be easily forgotten. If a kingdom was to be in a battle with another, soldiers will only fight if they have a worse outcome if they do not; a fight on love will be faulty: why would somebody who loves you risk your life for their own power? Fear will bring courageous followers and a powerful defence force against others as they fear a worse punishment if their performance is not courageous and strong whereas love will bring only people who believe but are not willing to protect as they will be selfish and only think about their well-being when it comes to war. If you are feared the people will know your true power over the land, and with a bit of courage and pride they will believe your strength is immense and mighty and worship you to be on your good list. Although a loved leader will have true friendship; fear is the key to break any relationship and bonds. Love is subjective and can be easily moulded when their perspective or opinion changes on you; whereas fear is objective and can not be removed or changed only strengthened and will always remain in the victims memories. Therefore fear is more reliable and strong and will mean your power is greater over your people.##$$##@@http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/It_s_better_to_be_feared_than_loved_Machiavelli@#@#@I agree but only under one other circumstance.

When hiring new employees employers should be required to consider citizens first, and only consider immigrants when there are no qualified Americans applying for the position, and by that I do mean that if an immigrant is better qualified (education, experience, etc.) he should be hired over an American less qualified but if the two are equally qualified citizenship should come first.##$$##@@http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/What_is_your_opinion_on_U_S_immigration@#@#@Spend your time wisely if you can ever figure out math there Brit Troll.##$$##@@http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/Math_question_for_the_Democrats@#@#@So is obstruction of justice you tedious idiot I have to break down everything Barney style for you...

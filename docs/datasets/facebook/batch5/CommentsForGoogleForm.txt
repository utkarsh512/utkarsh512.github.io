Linda Hayward Rheaume too bad we live in a Republic. You don’t even understand the form of government we have...##$$##@@https://www.facebook.com/joebiden/posts/10158316732666104@#@#@I was devastated in 2016 when tRump won, but I thought to myself “how bad can it be”? Well, as we all can now see, It was so much worse than anyone could have imagined.##$$##@@https://www.facebook.com/barackobama/posts/10158748745421749@#@#@Ivan Mraz that is what president FD Roosevelt wanted for the US but he died before he could achieve it. Then we know Republicans would never allow it.##$$##@@https://www.facebook.com/barackobama/posts/10158826093986749@#@#@Well then close that loophole. I don’t get any loophole from AMT… But what we DON’T want is to raise our corporate tax rate to a point where our corporations are forced to move overseas.##$$##@@https://www.facebook.com/joebiden/posts/10158517461716104@#@#@Amanda Carol House that's all they know is hate speech, demeaning comments, and violence. They don't know how to gracefully disagree with anyone. They don't know how to research through scholarly articles. They have never studied in depth history, nor political science. To argue back with them is like arguing with a child. Not worth the effort really. Welcome to the mentally ill club so petty##$$##@@https://www.facebook.com/joebiden/posts/10158503184056104@#@#@Terri McCall actually it would be nice to see the support payers get a little something. I mean the ones that actually pay, there are those that do.##$$##@@https://www.facebook.com/barackobama/posts/10158766914356749@#@#@Roy Mcmacken and theres plenty of veterans who will tell you that they may not agree with him, but they fought for him to be able to do exactly what he did and would do it again.##$$##@@https://www.facebook.com/FoxNews/posts/10161075596886336@#@#@Yes there were some problems, although considering the scope of the operation, I think they’re pretty minor. Everybody knows everything and everybody could’ve done a better job. Yeah, right. It’s a tough situation. We needed to be out and now we’re out. Move on.##$$##@@https://www.facebook.com/joebiden/posts/10158464778106104@#@#@Ryan Smith are you a Russian hoaxer?

I just think it should be fair.##$$##@@https://www.facebook.com/joebiden/posts/10158574441596104@#@#@Courtney Faith Almodovar yes that’s true, and if Baldwin was responsible for anything in this occurrence, he was responsible for that. However, if he was filming at the time of the accident ( can’t remember what the story said), and the script called for gunplay, the actor was just doing his job. The crew that handles the weapons were at fault for not ensuring the gun wasn’t loaded with dangerous projectiles. That’s the way it seems to me.##$$##@@https://www.facebook.com/FoxNews/posts/10161085188296336@#@#@Melanie Morgan you are what’s gone wrong with America! Are you really that filled with hatred and rage? President Obama was expressing sorrow and concern for the loved ones of our soldiers. How dare you enter spewing your vitriol.

The Republicans are going in the wrong direction, they support the BIG LIE, they support the insurrections to our capital, and they gave tax cuts for the rich. Who is in a good healthy mind will support such party?##$$##@@https://www.facebook.com/joebiden/posts/10158495171911104@#@#@Joe Manchik for Congress You are barking up the wrong tree and the wrong post!

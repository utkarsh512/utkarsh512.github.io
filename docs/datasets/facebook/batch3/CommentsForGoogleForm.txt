Fox Amalie Trump is the worst president in history. Of course Democrats would get the trifecta. It’s over Trump cult followers.

Trump fought to get him in when he could have gone on to the next person in line. It’s shocking that all three people he appointed turned their backs on him. I’d like to know what really happened regarding their decision.##$$##@@https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/posts/10165996573355725@#@#@Melanie Morgan you are what’s gone wrong with America! Are you really that filled with hatred and rage? President Obama was expressing sorrow and concern for the loved ones of our soldiers. How dare you enter spewing your vitriol.
